<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<hr class="short">
</div>

<p>In the foreword to his book on “The Reformation in
Germany,” Prof. Henry C. Vedder makes this statement:
“The great religious struggle of the sixteenth century was
only a phase of the social revolution then going on in Europe
and effecting a transformation of all its institutions. Momentous
economic changes were the underlying cause of
political and religious movements.… The external events
of the Reformation have been told before with substantial
accuracy; what is now needed is illumination of the facts by
the light of this new knowledge.”</p>

<p>The present study on the Reformation in Poland attempts
to gather together material of social and economic nature
and to point out that the underlying causes of the rise and
spread of the Reformation in Poland were chiefly social and
economic rather than religious, or even purely political.
Viewed in this light, the rapid rise and the phenomenal
growth of the Polish Reformation, as well as its almost complete
collapse in the course of the following century, become
quite intelligible. Had the movement had its roots in deep
religious convictions, it would have survived the changes in
social institutions, but, having been inspired and stimulated
in its early development by economic motives, it lost its
dynamic force with changed economic conditions by the end
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the writer has had access to only a
part of the great abundance of source material bearing on
this subject, the study does not pretend to be exhaustive.
However, it has the merit of being the first attempt to portray
the development of the Polish Reformation in the light of
economic causes, and in the judgment of the writer the conclusions
here reached and the interpretation given the movement
are essentially sound.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">viii</span></p>

<p>In this place the writer wishes to express his indebtedness
to Dr. John M. Vincent, Professor of European History at
Johns Hopkins University, for his encouragement in the
prosecution of this study and for his valuable suggestions
and criticisms, and to Miss Mary C. Stokes, of the Historical
Department in the University, for her careful reading of the
manuscript before its going to press.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I</abbr></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Development of the Reformation in Poland</span></h4>
</div>


<p class="p2"><i>The Background of the Polish Reformation.</i>—The Reformation
found in Poland a fertile soil and a congenial atmosphere
for its spread and growth.</p>

<p>To begin with, the attitude of the Polish princes was one
of independence. They had from early times carefully
guarded and vigorously defended their royal rights and prerogatives
against the church’s pretensions and efforts at
usurpation of power. When, for instance, Stanislaus Szczepanowski,
bishop of Cracow, encouraged by Gregory <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr>’s
triumph over Henry <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr>, attempted to make Gregory’s policy
prevail in Poland by placing himself at the head of the
disaffected powerful Polish aristocracy, to whom a strong
executive power was distasteful, and who desired to dethrone
the reigning king and to enthrone his weak subservient
brother, Boleslaus the Bold (1058-1080) did not hesitate to
put the rebellious bishop promptly to death.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> When Archbishop
Henry Kietlicz, under the influence of Innocent <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>
(1198-1216), determined to introduce the Gregorian reforms
into Poland at any cost, Wladislaus, surnamed Langshanks
(1202-1206), resolutely opposed the move even at the cost of
his throne.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Again, when the Polish clergy opposed a change
in the payments of tithes, from payments in kind to payments
in money, Boleslaus the Bald, of Silesia, ordered the
imprisonment of Thomas, bishop of Breslau, together with
one of his canons, had them put in stocks, and though the
archbishop of Gnesen excommunicated Boleslaus and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Pope ordered the archbishops of Gnesen and Magdeburg to
proclaim a crusade against him, Boleslaus did not yield until
Thomas made peace with the prince by paying a fine of 2000
silver marks and by agreeing to payments of tithes in money.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
And when later the bishop of Breslau opposed the levying
of a tax on the clergy for the benefit of the prince’s treasury,
Boleslaus’ son, Henry, now prince of Silesia, exiled the recalcitrant
bishop. Though excommunicated for this act by
the archbishop of Gnesen, he did not permit the bishop’s
return until after five years of exile, the bishop finally yielding
and submitting to the tax.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Besides these instances, there were others. Leszek the
Black (1279-1288) was at odds with the bishop of Cracow,
Paul of Przemankow. The bishop, an implacable enemy of
the king, conspired against the king, incited the aristocracy
against him, and caused even an invasion of Little Poland
by the Lithuanians and the Jadźwings. The king dispersed
the invaders, confiscated the bishop’s property, and imprisoned
him in the Castle of Sieradz, putting him in stocks.
It was only when the Pope threatened Leszek with excommunication
that the king liberated the imprisoned bishop.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
In the fourteenth century Casimir the Great (1333-1370)
imposed a tax on episcopal property. The Polish high clergy
resented that, and excommunicated the king. Casimir ordered
the priest, who brought the bull of excommunication
to him, to be seized and drowned in the Vistula River. And
since Casimir was a powerful and popular ruler, the clergy
took due warning, and desisted from further provocative
steps.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Moreover, it is worthy of note that while in Germany
the right of investiture was surrendered as early at
1122 by the Concordat of Worms, in Poland the princes
defended and retained the right as late as 1206.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And in
the second half of the fifteenth century, taking advantage
of the existing schism in the church at that time, they again
regained it, and made it a permanent and indisputable prerogative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
of the Polish crown.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Even such a loyal son of the
church as Sigismund the Old (1506-1548) did not allow the
Pope to interfere with his right in this particular. When
at the beginning of Sigismund’s reign the Pope deliberately
nominated a candidate for the bishopric of Płock, the king
refused to accept the papal nominee, stating that he would
never consent to such violation of the country’s laws by
allowing anyone else to nominate the kingdom’s senators.
Again, when later in Sigismund’s reign Pope Hadrian VI
was delaying his approval of the king’s nomination of Leszczyński
to the bishopric of Posen, Sigismund notified the
Vatican that the Pope’s refusal to comply with his just
wishes might result in unpleasant consequences to the Holy
See; whereupon the Vatican at once approved Leszczyński’s
nomination to the bishopric of Posen.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>An equal measure of independence characterized the Polish
high clergy in respect to its relation to the Vatican. Prince
Wladislaus <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> (1138-1146), striving to establish a strong
unified and centralized government in defiance of the provisions
of his father’s will, which divided the kingdom among
four of his sons, aroused the opposition of the aristocracy and
of the clergy, to whom a strong centralized government was
very unpalatable. James of Żnin, archbishop of Gnesen, as
leader of the opposition, excommunicated the stubborn ambitious
prince, and forced him to abdicate. Wladislaus
appealed his case to Conrad <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, emperor of Germany, and
to the Pope. Both of them responded, the emperor with a
military expedition and the Pope with a legate. When on
arrival in Poland the Pope’s legate, Cardinal Guido, was
unable to secure a return of the throne to Wladislaus, he
excommunicated the opponents, and placed the country under
an interdict. The Polish bishops, however, paid no attention
to the legate’s excommunication and interdict; and Wladislaus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
though supported by the Pope, had to remain in exile
until his death in 1159.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Wladislaus, surnamed Langshanks
(1202-1206), in his opposition to the Gregorian reforms,
upon which Pope Innocent <abbr title="Three">III</abbr> insisted, had the support
of many high church dignitaries among the Polish
clergy. Philip, bishop of Posen, for instance, refused to
promulgate in his diocese the papal interdict, under which
Archbishop Kietlicz was instructed to place the country.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
To what extent the Polish clergy disregarded papal decrees
may be seen from the fact that though Pope Gregory <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr>
(1073-1085) decreed a general enforcement of celibacy
among the Roman clergy, marriage among the clergy of
Poland, according to the historian Długosz, was still generally
common as late as the close of the twelfth and the first
quarter of the thirteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is quite instructive
to note that even such high church dignitaries as John Łaski
and James Uchański, both archbishops and primates of Poland,
the first from 1510 to 1531 and the second from 1562
to 1578, were very unfavorably disposed toward the Vatican.
As bishop and secretary of state, Łaski declined to support
the Pope’s project of forming a league against the Turks.
As archbishop of Gnesen and primate of Poland, he worked
for the emancipation of his archbishopric from Rome to such
an extent as to alarm not only his enemies, but even his
friends and the king himself.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Uchański’s orthodoxy and
loyalty to Rome had been long under suspicion at the Vatican;
so much so that when Sigismund Augustus (1548-1572)
appointed him to the bishopric of Chełm, the Pope did not
ratify the appointment for several years, and when the king
promoted Uchański to the bishopric of Kuyavia, the Pope
refused to sanction the promotion altogether. This served
only to estrange Uchański from the Vatican still more, and
led him, especially on his elevation to the archbishopric of
Gnesen, to entertain plans and to advocate the advisability
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of calling a National Synod and of withdrawing the Church
of Poland from the jurisdiction of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> When the papal
legate, Commendoni, dreading such a consequence, urged the
Vatican to forbid, contrary to the decisions of the Council
of Trent, the holding of Provincial Synods in Poland for
fear that one of them might at any time be turned into a
National Synod, the Polish bishops rose in protest against
it in the senate of the Diet, going even so far as to declare
that the king, and not the Pope, was their overlord and
judge.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The people, too, manifested the same spirit of independence
in their attitude toward the church, whenever occasion
demanded. In the eleventh century they arose in rebellion
against the oppression of both state and church, particularly
the church, owing to the foreign character of its clergy and
their burdensome exactions. They demolished churches and
monasteries, drove out the priests and the monks, and reverted
to paganism.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In the struggles of the state with the
papacy for supremacy the people generally supported the
state. This explains the boldness and self-confidence of the
Polish rulers, with which they successfully opposed the pretensions
of the papacy much longer than the German emperors.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The papal anathema, hurled against recalcitrant
princes and shaking the very foundations of Western thrones,
fell in Poland without causing much disturbance or harm.</p>

<p>Another factor, which in a large measure prepared the
soil for the spread of the Reformation in Poland, was humanism.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The new turn in literature and philosophy reached
Poland early in the fifteenth century, and found many
friends both among the laity and among the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of the most distinguished Polish humanists was John Ostrorog
(1402-1501), a doctor of both laws from the University
of Erfurt and a strong advocate of the supremacy of the
state over the church. In his dissertation, “Monumentum
pro reipublicae ordinatione congestum,” Ostrorog wrote in
1473:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Polish king recognises nobody’s supremacy save that of God;
instead of assuring the new Pope of his obedience he will sufficiently
fulfill his duty if he congratulate him, and at the same time remind
him that he should rule the church justly. It is below the dignity of
the king to write to the Pope with humility and humbleness.…
The clergy should help bear the burdens of the state as well as
other citizens; there is no need of being indignant when the king
orders the melting of church utensils for public needs. The church
has gold not for the purpose of keeping it, but for the purpose of
helping the needy. All payments for the benefit of the Pope should
be abolished. Poland needs all the funds she can spare for war
with invaders and for the preservation of domestic order and peace.
The proclamation of jubilee papal bulls as well as fees for funerals,
marriages, etc., should be prohibited. The king should nominate the
bishops. In order to decrease the number of idlers, the establishment
of monasteries in cities should be restricted, the admission for foreigners
to them prohibited, and sermons in the German language
diminished in number.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div>

<p>“Such were the predominant sentiments of the time,” says
Dr. Lewinski-Corwin, “in true keeping with the teachings
of humanism, which spread in Poland through constant contact
with Germany and Italy, in the principles of which
several generations preceding the Reformation had been
reared, and in accordance with which they shaped their views
and opinions.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The condition of the Polish church and the character of
the Polish clergy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, too,
were favorable to the spread of Reformation ideas in Poland.
Lorkiewicz characterizes the Polish church and the Polish
clergy of this period thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The church, which by its calling and its nature, should be the
guardian of the oppressed, the defender of the weak against the
strong, the moral guide of men, and the regulator of social conditions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
had allied itself with those social factors which sap the very
life-blood of society, offering it in exchange only a form without content,
a body without a soul. It had become a ballast, not such as
steadies the easy movement of a light vessel, but such as threatens
the storm-tossed ship with certain destruction. The clergy, if it is
fit to use such unpalatable comparison, was at this time like an old
church beggar, who, having said the prayers that had been paid for,
had nothing more pressing to do than to hurry and in a particular
and characteristic manner waste the alms he had received.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Polish clergy led as dissolute a life as did the clergy
elsewhere in Europe. The Polish bishops were far more
interested in their incomes, their social standing, and in their
political influence than in religion and morals. The indignation
of the nobles, therefore, at the freedom the clergy
enjoyed from taxation and other burdens was intense. They
were strongly opposed to church tithes and to ecclesiastic
jurisdiction, and resented papal interference in matters of
state.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Pre-Reformation Reform Movements.</i>—Into this receptive
Polish soil the seed of religious reform had been sown from
time to time for nearly four hundred years; and as it grew
and developed, though greatly hindered from time to time,
it helped to create an atmosphere favorable to the main religious
reform movement of the sixteenth century. The followers
of Peter Waldo, persecuted in Italy, sought safety in
other countries. As early as 1176 some of them found refuge
in Bohemia, and others settled in Poland, near Cracow.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Here they spread their master’s teachings, and found many
adherents both among the Czechs and among the Poles.
Polish chronicles record the names of a number of Waldensian
Poles.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In time these Waldensians must have become
sufficiently numerous and active; for Pope John <abbr title="Twenty-two">XXII</abbr> found
it imperative to appoint in 1326 a special Inquisitor for
Poland in the person of Peter of Kolomea, a Dominican,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and
in 1330 the Inquisition discovered that there were many Poles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and Czechs visiting the Waldensian churches in Italy and
making liberal contributions to them.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Wyclif’s influence reached Poland by way of Bohemia
through the Masters of the University of Prague, who at the
Polish king’s request became the reorganizers of the University
of Cracow.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Andrew Gałka, a professor in the University
of Cracow, an ardent admirer of Wyclif and a diligent
student of his works, wrote a poem in which he praised
the English reformer, and denounced the priests as servants
of the German emperor and his Antichrist, who suppressed
the truth and taught the common people falsehoods.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> For
this poem and for having Wyclif’s works in his possession he
was expelled from the University and imprisoned. He escaped,
however, from his imprisonment, and sought the protection
of Boleslaus of Silesia, whence he carried on an extensive
correspondence, justifying his position and urging
his readers to read Wyclif’s works.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the existence of close political and intellectual
relations<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> between Bohemia and Poland in the fifteenth
century, Hussitism found easy access to the latter country,
and attracted many followers and sympathizers from among
the Poles. Its anti-German, anti-papal, and nationalistic
character found a responsive chord in their hearts. Huss and
his ideas met with great favor on the part of many of them.
At the Council of Constance the Polish lay representatives
sided with the Bohemian delegation, and loyally defended
Huss and his cause to the last. A number of powerful
Polish aristocratic families, like Spytek of Melsztyn, Abraham
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of Zbonsz, Dersław of Rytwian, and others, became
ardent supporters and defenders of Hussitism.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Abraham
of Zbonsz harbored and protected Hussite preachers in his
possessions for years in spite of the fact that he was excommunicated
for this offense by the bishop of Posen.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Hussitism
was spreading in Poland to such an extent as to cause
alarm among the church authorities. The archbishop of
Gnesen, Nicholas Tromba, called a synod to assemble at Kalisz,
at which it was decided to apprehend suspected heretics
and to deliver them into the hands of ecclesiastical tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki used his influence with
the king, and secured from him the Edict of Wieluń (1424).
By this edict the new teachings were declared to be deadly
errors of heretics, contemptible to God, detrimental to the
Christian faith, enervating to the body politic, inflammatory
of perverse hearts, and should be repulsed and kept out of
the country, if need be, by the sword. Heretics, protectors
of heretics, and heretical suspects were to be regarded as
traitors, and were to be punished by death. Those coming
from Bohemia and entering Poland were to be examined by
Inquisitors, and if suspected of heresy, they were to be detained.
Polish subjects, whatever their class or condition,
visiting or residing in Bohemia, were to return to their country
by next Ascension Day; and if they failed to do so, they
were to be regarded as heretics, subject to punishment as heretics.
Obstinate heretics were to be punished by confiscation of
property in favor of the crown treasury,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and neither the offenders
themselves nor their posterity were to be admitted to
any public office or to any official honors. And Polish merchants
were forbidden to export anything to the heretics of
Bohemia.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>In spite of this drastic edict, intended to check the spread
of Hussitism in Poland, the Bohemian Hussites sent some of
their emissaries to Cracow in 1427 for the purpose of conducting
religious discussions. The Polish historian Długosz,
who was Cardinal Oleśnicki’s secretary, reports that such a
discussion, in which the Hussite representatives and the Roman
Catholic doctors of the University of Cracow participated,
was actually held in the city of Cracow in 1431, in
the presence of the king, and characteristically adds that the
heretics were vanquished, but would not admit it.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>On January 30, 1433, due again to Cardinal Oleśnicki’s
influence, another royal edict was issued against the heretics.
Its intention was to lend effectiveness to ecclesiastical excommunications
by providing for seizures by the starostas<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
of the property of excommunicated church offenders, who had
been under the ban of the church for more than a year without
effort to have it lifted.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>It seems that even this measure did not materially help to
keep the Hussite heresy in check. After the death of Wladislaus
Jagiello in 1434 the Hussites were strong enough to
offer some opposition to the regency of Cardinal Olesńicki;
for he and his party entered into a pact of confederation at
Korczyn on April 25, 1438, for the purpose of acting together
to subdue any possible political or religious disturbance.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
To counteract this, the opposition, headed by Spytek of
Melsztyn, the acknowledged leader of the Hussites, entered
into a similar pact on the third of May of the year following.
This step on the part of the Hussites led to a clash between
the two confederated parties, resulting in Spytek’s death,
confiscation of his property, and in the ruin of the Spytek
family.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>That all these measures were ineffective to check the spread
of Hussitism in Poland is further evident from the fact that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Casimir Jagiello (1447-1492), the king who restored to the
Polish crown the right of investiture, lost to the Pope in
1206, issued in 1454 an order to the civil authorities in the
dioceses of Gnesen, Posen, Włocław, and Płock to the effect
that they cooperate with the appointed inquisitors in running
down heretics.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It must not be supposed, however, that Casimir
Jagiello was a zealous defender of the Roman Church and
a determined opponent of Hussitism. In 1462 he entered into
an alliance with the excommunicated Hussite king, George
Podjebrad of Bohemia, and maintained the alliance in the
face of strong inducements as well as threats from the Catholic
party to break it. When the Pope in his opposition to
Podjebrad had gone so far as to attempt a crusade against
the Hussites in Poland, Casimir sternly prohibited the proclamation
of it.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the western parts of Poland the traces
of Hussitism were so deep that as late as 1500 the nobility
of Great Poland demanded the cup at communion.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The
work of the Hussites was reenforced by demands for reform,
made by loyal sons of the Church of Rome, who had caught
the spirit of Hussitism. Two men, both professors of theology
at the University of Cracow, though at different times,
Matthew of Cracow and James of Paradyż, became especially
conspicuous within the Polish Roman Catholic Church in
the fifteenth century for their advocacy of reform. Matthew
of Cracow was born in 1330 of a family of town clerks
(Stadtschreiber). Having received his preparatory education
in his home town, he went to study theology at the University
of Prague, where he took all the University degrees one
after another, and finally in 1387 became professor of theology.
In 1394 he went as professor of theology to the University
of Heidelberg, and in 1396 he was made rector of
that University. In 1397 he was called to Cracow for the
purpose of reorganizing the University, founded in 1364 by
Casimir the Great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
The University of Prague made an indelible impression
upon him, and to its influence he felt that he owed everything.
His conception of the church and his views of church
matters were likewise the product of the University of Prague.
And Matthew became not only a theologian, but also a reformer.
While at the University of Cracow, he published in
1404 a pamphlet under the title, <span lang="la">“De squaloribus curiae
Romanae.”</span> In it, as well as in his sermons, lectures, and
other writings, he condemned simony, defended the superiority
of church councils over the Pope, severely criticized the
existing form of religion as a mere semblance of Christianity,
held the stupidity of church theologians responsible for
the decline of scriptural religious faith, and demanded reforms.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>As the spirit of the University of Prague made Matthew
of Cracow, so the spirit of Matthew’s theology made James
of Paradyż. Born about 1380, James entered the monastic
Order of the Cistercians at Paradyż at the age of twenty.
In 1420 he was studying at the University of Cracow, from
which in 1432 he received its highest degree, namely that of
Doctor of Decretals, or of Theology. In 1431 he participated
in the famous public discussion with the Hussites in the
king’s presence. Though loyal to the Church of Rome, James
nevertheless became an ardent advocate of church reform,
particularly of the monastic life. He went so far as to propose
the confiscation of monastic property of all monastic
orders which had become too worldly. In consequence of
this revolutionary proposal, he was forced to leave his Order
at Mogila and his chair of theology at the University of
Cracow. Accustomed to the discipline of the monastic life,
however, he entered the Order of the Carthusians at Erfurt,
and continued his labors along the line of church reform
both by preaching and by writing until his death in 1464.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>That by the beginning of the sixteenth century the ground
in Poland was fairly well prepared for the spread of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
coming Reformation is made further evident by the character
of some of the books published and the opinions circulated
in the country at that time. In 1504, for instance, there
appeared from the press in Cracow two significant books,
<span lang="la">“De vero cultu Dei,”</span> and <span lang="la">“De matrimonio sacerdotum.”</span>
These books contained views decidedly unfavorable to the
church, and, as it was to be expected, were condemned by it.
In 1515, Bernard of Lublin, writing to Simon of Cracow,
expressed the opinion that the Gospel was all-sufficient for
faith and practice and that all other precepts of men could
be dispensed with.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>


<p class="p2"><i>The Spread of the Reformation in Poland. First Period,
1518-1540: Early Beginnings and Struggles.</i>—The Reformation
reached Poland soon after its outbreak in Germany,
and spread rapidly. Following lines of least resistance, it
penetrated through the established channels of trade and
commerce and education into the larger commercial centres,
where there was a considerable German element, and into the
life of the country aristocracy, which sought knowledge and
culture in the universities of Germany.</p>

<p>The first Polish city to feel its influence and to respond to
it was the important commercial city of Danzig. In less
than a year from the posting of Luther’s theses on the door
of the castle church at Wittenberg, Luther’s reform doctrines
were preached and championed in Danzig. The man who
accepted them and began to preach them publicly was James
Knade, a monk and preacher at the Church of St. Peter and
St. Paul. Knade renounced his monastic vows, married
Anna, the beautiful step-daughter of James Rohboze, a
wealthy burgher of Danzig, and, fearlessly opposing Rome
and Roman practices, advocated reforms in the church.
Being a popular preacher, liked and respected by the people
of the city, his activity was very dangerous to the Church of
Rome. He was, therefore, seized, by order of the bishop of
Kuyavia, tried, found guilty, and imprisoned. Shortly after
his imprisonment, he was released, but had to leave the city.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
He took refuge on the estate of a country gentleman by the
name of Krokow, near the city of Thorn, where, protected
by his patron, he continued his reform activity without
further interference.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Suppressed for a time, the reform movement broke out
again four years later with accumulated force. The interval
had given the people of Danzig time to think, to form opinions,
and to take sides either for or against the Reformation.
The year 1522, therefore, found the majority of the people
of Danzig in favor of the Reformation. Some, however,
wanted to carry it through conservatively, others by radical
action. The advocates of conservative reform were drawn
from among the well-to-do, and included the city council.
The radicals came from the plebeian class, and represented
the wishes of the common people. The conservatives favored
the dogmatic aspect of the new reform movement, and opposed
changes in organization, forms, and practices. The
radicals, on the other hand, kept their eyes on the practical
aspects of the new ideas, and proposed to carry them out to
their logical limit.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The leader of the conservative reform
party was Dr. Alexander, a Franciscan friar, an eloquent
preacher, thoroughly educated and well balanced. The leader
of the radical reform party was James Hegge, at first
preacher at various churches outside the city wall, then prebendary
of St. Mary’s, the largest and most beautiful church
in the city, and still later of St. Catherine’s. Hegge was
likewise an eloquent and popular preacher and a man of a
very practical turn of mind.</p>

<p>While Hegge was the first to come forward in July, 1522,
with a fresh attack upon the Church of Rome and its clergy,
advocating the necessity of religious and ecclesiastical reforms
both in doctrine and in practice, the conservative
reform party, headed by Dr. Alexander, was able to control
and to guide the movement for some time.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> At length,
however, the control of it passed into the hands of the radicals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
These were not satisfied with any half-way measures,
like preaching the new doctrines, while still retaining the old
forms and practices. They began to demolish all sacred pictures,
to clean out the churches of all forms of idolatry, and
to give up old practices.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Owing to their strength and
pressure, the conservative city government was induced to
issue a proclamation, freeing all monks and nuns from their
monastic vows, forbidding new candidates to enter any monastic
order, and restraining all monks from preaching, hearing
confessions, soliciting contributions, and visiting homes.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Conscious now of its power, the radical reform party went
still farther, and demanded a share in politics and in the
government of the city, with the result that early in 1525 it
finally overthrew the conservative aristocratic city council,
and established a popular city government.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The new city
council closed all monasteries and convents, abolished Roman
forms of worship, took possession of all church property, and
appointed Lutheran preachers.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In its results, then, the
Danzig Reformation was not only religious and ecclesiastical,
but also social and political.</p>

<p>The accomplished reforms, however, were too thorough-going
and too far-reaching to be lasting. The ecclesiastical
authorities and the overthrown city council appealed to King
Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr> (1506-1548) for help. The king, a loyal Catholic,
first sent a commission to inquire into the situation and
to restore the old order of things. When the insurrectionary
city government would not yield to the representatives of the
royal commission, the king in person set out for Danzig,
accompanied by an armed force, forced the new city government
into submission, punished fifteen of the revolutionary
lay leaders by ordering them to be beheaded, and restored the
former aristocratic city government and the Roman Catholic
form of worship.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In reality the king’s intervention restored only the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
political order of things. The old religion was restored in
outward appearance only, and for the time being as a matter
of expedience. At heart the people of Danzig remained
thoroughly sympathetic with the new religious teaching and
the proposed religious reforms. So did the aristocratic city
council now restored again to power as a result of the king’s
intervention. With the restoration of the conservatives to
power every effort was made to preserve the old forms of
worship. At the same time the conservative aristocratic city
council saw to it that to the pulpits of all the more important
city churches only preachers sympathetic with the new teaching
were appointed.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Under the leadership of this council
and such conservative and tactful men as Dr. Alexander,
Urban Ulric, Peter Bischoff, Pancratius Klemme, and
Klein, the Reformation in Danzig went forward quietly, and
by 1540 became an accomplished fact, not only in spirit, but
also in form. This being the case, the king acquiesced.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The Reformation spread rapidly to other West Prussian
cities, and was accepted everywhere with enthusiasm. In the
city of Thorn, the birth-place of Copernicus, Luther’s doctrines
were preached as early as 1520-1521. That they were
favorably received and found many adherents may be seen
from the following incident. The papal legate Ferrei, having
come to Thorn at this time, proceeded publicly to burn
Luther’s portrait and some of his writings before the Church
of St. John. The residents of the city made an attack on
him and his followers, drove them away with stones, and
rescued Luther’s picture from the flames.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It is more than
probable that the ferment the Reformation was causing at
Thorn was partly responsible for the publication in that city,
July the 24, 1520, of the king’s Thorn Edict, by which the
importation of Luther’s writings into the land were forbidden
under penalty of confiscation of all property and of exile
from the country.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>In Braunsberg, the seat of the bishop of Warmya, the
Lutheran form of worship was introduced in 1520 without
the bishop’s persecution of the innovators. When the cathedral
canons upbraided the bishop for his leniency, he laconically
replied that Luther based his doctrines on the Scriptures,
and that whosoever felt himself capable of refuting
them was welcome to undertake the job.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Other West
Prussian cities, too, felt the force of the new movement, and
responded to it in varied degrees. The Reformation struck
roots into the West Prussian soil so deeply that even the
vigorous suppression of it in Danzig in 1526 and the following
reaction through West Prussia were unable to exterminate
it.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The attitude of the West Prussian cities toward the Reformation
exerted a strong influence on the Duchy of East
Prussia, since 1466 a vassal principality of Poland.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In
1525, the year when the Reformation resulted in most far-reaching
changes in Danzig, Albert Hohenzollern, Grand Master
of the Order of the Teutonic Knights, left the Roman
Church, accepted Lutheranism, secularized the possessions
of the Order with the consent of the Polish king, and by
the Treaty of Cracow of the same year became the secular
hereditary ruler of the vassal Duchy of East Prussia with a
right to the first seat in the Polish Senate.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The Pope and
the German emperor naturally protested against this arrangement,
but without any effect. Owing to the popularity
of the Reformation in West Prussia and the revolution it
caused in the city of Danzig, and fearing that a refusal to
grant Albert’s request might lead him to bring to a head the
reform movement in the whole of Prussia and possibly tear
the whole Prussian territory away from the kingdom, Sigismund
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
<abbr title="One">I</abbr> preferred to sanction the arrangement described
above even at the risk of being suspected of disloyalty to the
Church of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In accordance with the agreement made
with the Polish crown, Duke Albert commanded, by an edict
issued July 6, 1525, that the Holy Gospel, the word of Christ,
pure and simple, be preached in his possessions “under the
penalty of exile.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> At the same time he made every effort
to evangelize the population of the Duchy. For this purpose
he secured through Bishop Speratus of Pomerania the publication
at Wittenberg of Luther’s Shorter Catechism. A copy
of this catechism he sent in 1531 by Nipczyc to Chojnicki,
archdeacon of Cracow, who read it eagerly.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The introduction and legalization of the Reformation in
East Prussia, one of Poland’s autonomous provinces, exerted
a potent influence in favor of the movement’s spread in other
parts of the country. Duke Albert became a patron and
promoter of the new movement. He established in Königsberg
a press, from which thousands of Polish religious pamphlets
and books were issued, and a university, in which several
generations of Polish Protestant ministers received their
education. Thus East Prussia became a place of refuge for
reformers and adherents of the new faith, persecuted in other
parts of Poland, as well as a training ground for Polish
Protestant clergy, and a source of Polish Protestant literature.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>In the neighboring Duchy of Mazovia the Reformation did
not make much progress. Yet even here it evidently met
with some success; for Duke Janusz of Mazovia felt it to be
necessary to issue in 1525 at a council assembled in Warsaw
an edict, forbidding, under penalty of death and confiscation
of all property for the benefit of the ducal treasury, the
possession and reading of Luther’s writings in whatever language,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the teaching of his doctrines, or any discussion of
them with anyone.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the close proximity of Great Poland to Saxony
and Wittenberg, Luther’s reforms reached it quickly. In
1524 King Sigismund found it necessary to dispatch a special
emissary in the person of Nicholas Tomicki, starosta of
Kościan, to the town of Kościan to suppress the spread of
heretical views there, and to call upon the town authorities
to assist Tomicki in his mission in every way possible.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In
the city of Posen, according to Prof. H. Merczyng, Luther’s
doctrines were preached publicly from the pulpit of Mary
Magdalene’s Church by its preacher, John Seklucyan, in
1525.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> For this offense Seklucyan was removed from his
post by the magistracy of the city at the king’s behest. He
found a protector, however, in the powerful magnate Andrew
Górka, who sheltered him in his own palace in Posen, and
secured for him from the king in the course of time a position
as secretary of customs in that city.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Seklucyan remained
in Posen until 1544, when he removed to Königsberg,
where he was very active for a number of years in the
preparation and publication of Polish Protestant literature.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The Reformation found favor with and protection from some
of the most powerful aristocratic families of Great Poland,
like the Górkas, Bnińskis, Tomickis, Ostrorogs, and Leszczyńskis.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
The German reform movement was reenforced
in Great Poland by the arrival there in 1548, on their way
to East Prussia, of the Bohemian Brethren, exiled from their
own country. During their brief stay in Great Poland,
under the protection of the Górkas, they made many friends,
won a considerable following, and laid the foundation for the
Bohemian Brethren Church of Great Poland. Though forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
to move on by a royal decree, issued on request of the bishop
of Posen, many of them returned later, when conditions had
changed, and settled in Posen and other places of Great
Poland. By 1557 the Bohemian Brethren had thirty
churches in Great Poland, and some of the foremost families,
like the Leszczyńskis, Krotowskis, Ostrorogs, Opalińskis, and
Tomickis, accepted their form of the Christian faith.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In Little Poland, too, the Reformation was making a good
deal of stir among certain classes of the population, and was
creating a good deal of uneasiness among its opponents.
The new ideas, soon after their appearance in Wittenberg,
began also to be circulated in the city of Cracow. Luther’s
books were imported into the city in defiance of the Edict of
Thorn, were freely circulated and read, and his doctrines
were even publicly preached.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> So popular were Luther’s
writings and his ideas in this city, that they caused the king,
writing from Grodno, February 15, 1522, to Chancellor
Szydłowiecki, to recommend to the City Council of Cracow
that it diligently cooperate in the enforcement of the Edict
of Thorn.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> A little more than a year later, March 7, 1523,
a new edict was issued in the city of Cracow, in which the
king recognized that the penalty provided in the Edict of
Thorn had failed to check the circulation of Luther’s books
and the spread of his teachings in the capital, and consequently
made it more severe. The transgressors of the edict
were to be punished not by exile, as heretofore, but by burning
at the stake as well as by confiscation of their property.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Evidently even this edict failed to accomplish the desired
object; for three months later, August 22, 1523, another
royal edict appeared. This new edict provided for the search
of the homes of the residents of the city of Cracow for heretical
books whenever the bishop of Cracow should ask the
city magistrates that such search be made. It also provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
for the censorship by the rector of the University of all books
printed in the city or imported from abroad. Persons in
whose possession heretical books were found, or publishers
and booksellers who published, imported or sold heretical
books, were to be punished according to the provisions of the
royal edicts.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This edict also calls on other municipalities
to adopt similar measures for the stamping out of heresy.</p>

<p>These royal decrees were called forth not by imaginary fear
of a non-existent evil, but by actual and steady growth of the
Reformation in Poland. There are a number of episcopal
court cases on record of persons arrested and tried for heresy.
In 1522 the parish-priest of Bienarów, near Bicz, Voyvodship
of Cracow, was arrested for praising and sympathizing
with Martin Luther. In 1525 sixteen persons were charged
in the city of Cracow with professing Luther’s teachings,
breaking fast-day regulations, denying the efficacy of prayers
for the dead, the existence of purgatory, and the value of
confession. These persons were of the lower social class,
artisans, organists, singers, etc. In the face of the severe
penalties provided for such offenders by the royal edicts, all
the accused naturally denied being guilty of the charges. In
1526 there were two cases of priests charged with heresy.
One of these was Bartholomew, rector of the school of Corpus
Christi in the suburb of Kazimir; the other Matthew of
Ropczyce. The latter was sentenced to confinement in the
clerical prison at Lipowiec. There was also a case of a book-dealer,
called Michael, who was charged with the importation
of heretical books; and one of a Bohemian blacksmith charged
with denial of Christ’s presence in the consecrated host. In
1530 another book-dealer by the name of Peter was charged
with importing Luther’s Catechism. He defended himself
by stating that he possessed only six copies of it. On December
10, 1532, four influential citizens of Cracow were
charged with professing Lutheranism. A similar case came
up the year following. Book-dealers seem to have been the
worst offenders and the hardest to deal with. In 1534 two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Cracovian book-dealers, Hieronimus Wietor and Philip
Winkler, were charged with selling books containing Lutheran
doctrines. At the same time similar books were found to
be in the possession of Matthew of Opoczyn, rector of the
church at Sieciechów. The most significant case on record,
however, was that of James of Iłża, preacher of the Church
of St. Stephen, Cracow, <span lang="la">“artium magistri et collegiati minoris
collegii.”</span> James started to preach Luther’s doctrines
openly from the pulpit of his church in 1528. When called
to account for it, he denied being guilty, and his case was
dismissed. But when he continued preaching the heretical
doctrines publicly, he was again haled before the bishop’s
court. This time he was ordered to retract the Lutheran
errors publicly from his pulpit. Instead of doing that James
escaped to Breslau. In consequence of that he was at once
adjudged and condemned as a heretic.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that neither royal edicts, nor episcopal court
decrees were able to check the spread of the religious reform
movement in Poland. The new ideas invaded even the king’s
court, and found followers among those nearest to the king
and to the queen. Justus Decius, the king’s private secretary,
was an admirer of the Reformation and knew Luther
personally. Francis Lismanini, an Italian Franciscan, private
confessor of Queen Bona, was a most ardent promoter
of the new movement.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The spread of the Reformation in Poland is registered not
only in the royal edicts, but also in the resolutions and decrees
of the ecclesiastical provincial synods. The clergy were
not particularly desirous to carry on a war with the religious
innovators. At the provincial synods of 1520 and 1522 the
Polish hierarchy took no action whatever regarding the new
movement. The synod of 1523 did not go beyond reaffirming
Leo <abbr title="Ten">X</abbr>’s bull, excommunicating Luther and condemning his
teaching, and repeating the king’s edicts which penalized the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
innovators and the promoters of innovations. Instead of
fighting the new movement, the Polish clergy were ready to
negotiate with the Protestants and to make concessions. In
fact, they went so far as to lay before Pope Clemens <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr> in
1525, through a special envoy, the Primate’s Chancellor
Myszkowski, their hard lot, and to appeal to him to call a
general synod together for the purpose of bringing about a
restoration of church unity. The Pope, however, engaged
at the time in a conflict with the emperor, made only promises
and exhorted the Polish clergy to greater religious zeal,
at the same time conferring on the primate of Poland full
powers to deal with the spreading heresy as circumstances
might demand, either to suppress the heresy or to absolve the
heretics.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Complying with the Pope’s exhortation, the next provincial
synod, assembled at Łęczyca in 1527, adopted more definite
and decided measures to combat effectively the spread of
the heretical movement. It resolved that every bishop
in the diocese appoint an Inquisitor, selected either from the
regular or from the secular clergy, who would be on the
lookout for heretics, and who would report them to the bishop
in order that they might be properly punished.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> But the
synod did not stop with repressive measures. It realized the
futility of repression without effective prevention. Therefore,
it further resolved to improve the general intellectual character
of the Polish clergy. Every bishop was to seek out
expert theologians and eloquent preachers, who would be able
to instruct the people and to expound to them the Scriptures
in a rational and intelligent way. These were to be given
appointments especially in places infected with heresy.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
And that the clergy might not lack for subjects to preach
upon, every clergyman was recommended to provide himself
with the Scriptures, the Church Fathers, Homilies, and
other similar books.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Then, too, the synod of that year was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
especially concerned about the atmosphere of the king’s environment.
It resolved that the king be requested to keep a
learned preacher at court, to hear him every holy day, and
especially during the sessions of the Diet. In this connection
the bishop in whose diocese the Diet met was charged
to appoint such a preacher for the king, in case the king
failed to provide himself with one.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The next two synods,
of 1530 and of 1532, favored the use of stern measures
against the importation of heretical books and against the
adherents of heretical doctrines.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>But these synodical edicts were no more effective in checking
the spread of the Reformation in Poland than were the
royal decrees.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Instead of intimidating the adherents of the
new religious movement, they stimulated them to greater
boldness. In 1534 at the provincial diet of Grodzisk the
nobility of Great Poland demanded books in the Polish language,
particularly the Bible. Every nation has writings in
its own language, it asserted; but as for us, the priests want
us to be ignorant.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The steady growth of the religious reform movement in
Poland led its opponents to the employment of extreme repressive
measures. In 1534 the Polish clergy secured from
the king an edict, forbidding the Polish nobility to send its
youth to any seat of learning known or suspected to be heretical.
Those that were at such universities were recalled. If
any refused to return, they were to be deprived of all rights
and privileges of citizenship. As was to be expected, the
edict was ignored. Hence, in 1540, in response to an appeal
from the clergy, the king issued a call on the starostas to
enforce the aforesaid edict<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and on the bishops to report
any violations of it in order that the recalcitrant parties
might be duly punished.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> By a law of 1538, owing to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
tendency of Germans to take up with heretical ideas, only
native Poles were to be appointed to abbacies of Polish monastic
institutions.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Moreover, in 1541 the king went so far
as to threaten those receiving and harboring heretical ministers
with the loss of all nobility rights and privileges.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And
to cap the climax, in 1539, Peter Gamrat, bishop of Cracow,
ordered Catherine Zalaszowska, an eighty-year old lady, the
wife of Melchior Zalaszowski, a member of the Cracow City
Council, to be burned, because of her opposition to the adoration
of the eucharistic host. The order was carried out, and
the old lady was executed.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>However, this execution of Catherine Zalaszowska by the
ecclesiastical authorities, and the threats of the king of 1540
and 1541, mark both the climax of the opposition and the
end of the first period of the religious reform movement in
Poland, the period of its early beginnings and defensive
struggles. From now on the movement assumes an aggressive
attitude.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Second Period, 1540-1548: Growing Aggressiveness.</i>—By
1540 German Lutheranism in Poland became reenforced by
Calvinism from Geneva. This new form of the religious
reform movement recommended itself more favorably to the
Poles because of its non-German origin, its recognition of
laymen in church councils, and because it was considered
more appropriate for a free republic.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Conversions to Calvinism
among the higher classes in Poland became now more
and more frequent. The relatives of the once famous Bishop
and Cardinal Oleśnicki, the Stadnickis, the Sienieńskis, the
Firleys, the Jazłowieckis, the Szafraniec family, and other
aristocratic families of Little Poland became adherents of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Calvinism.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The Grand Hetman of Poland, Jan Tarnowski,
though not an avowed adherent of Calvinism, yet corresponded
with John Calvin,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and openly opposed ecclesiastical
jurisdiction and Rome’s influence.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And in 1539 Calvin
dedicated his Commentary on the Mass to the young Crown
Prince, Sigismund Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>From now on the religious reform movement became the
most important topic of general discussion everywhere and
among all intelligent classes of Polish society. The abuses,
faults, and shortcomings of the church were being keenly felt
and freely talked about. Questions of faith, doctrine, and
church dogmas were engaging everybody’s attention, and were
discussed on every occasion and at every opportunity. They
constituted the main topic of conversation, and sometimes of
heated discussion, at dinners, feasts, and social gatherings,
particularly if members of the clerical profession were
present.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>This general interest of the intelligent classes of the Polish
people in the Reformation and the free discussion of the very
fundamentals on which the existing ecclesiastical system
rested were creating a great deal of uneasiness among the
higher clergy, and caused them to put forth still more determined
efforts in defense of the old faith and the old form
of worship, not altogether from religious motives but also
from economic and social considerations. The new movement
was undermining their material resources as well as
their social position and influence.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Every effort must,
therefore, be made and every means employed to check this
movement, if such a thing were possible. Thus at the Synod
of Piotrków in 1542 the clergy resolved to demand of the
king a strict enforcement of the royal edicts against heresy.
It resolved, also, to forbid parents to send their children to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
heretical schools; to prohibit the reading of heretical books,
which many were doing under the pretense of trying to
qualify themselves to refute the heresy; to search homes for
heretical writings; to enjoin the local authorities to keep a
close watch over the booksellers and printers; to seize suspected
works; and to punish all transgressors immediately
and without delay. The synod of 1544 reaffirmed the stand
of the church on these points, taken at the synod of 1542.
All these decrees remained largely ineffective, for they needed
for their enforcement the cooperation of civil authorities,
which, however, could not now readily be obtained, since all
the royal edicts and the synodical decrees against heresy violated
constitutional rights granted the nobility in the fifteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The synod of 1547 was, therefore, forced
to acknowledge the powerlessness of the church to cope with
the new movement, and to admit that in many dioceses of
Poland even the clergy were seriously affected by the spreading
heresy, and that the church was in imminent danger of
being swamped by it.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The futility of the decrees of the synod of 1542 becomes
still more apparent in the light of the stand of the Polish
nobility at the Diet of Cracow the following year. Open
aggressiveness and sympathy with the Reformation is here in
evidence. The nobility demanded of the king at this Diet
and secured (1) the retention within the country for purposes
of defense against foreign aggression of the annates paid to
the Pope, and (2) the revocation of the unconstitutional
edict of 1534, reaffirmed in 1540, forbidding Polish citizens
to study, or to educate their children abroad in universities
infected with heresy. In compliance with the urgent request
of the senators and the deputies the king agreed to send an
embassy to the Pope with a petition, which was more a notification
than a request, that the annates be allowed to be
retained in the country; and should the Pope refuse to agree
to that, he was to be at once notified that the annates would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
not be allowed to be given or exported from the country any
more.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> As to the second point, the edicts forbidding Polish
citizens to visit certain places abroad were abrogated, and
they were again given full liberty to visit foreign countries
for any purpose whatever, provided they were not accompanied
by a military retinue, or went to engage in war. But,
returning, they were not permitted to import heretical books,
or to disseminate among the common people doctrines not
accepted by the Roman Catholic Church. Whoever should be
found guilty of this offense, was to be prosecuted according
to the laws of the kingdom against heretics.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> This measure
reveals a recognition on the part of the king of the impossibility
of restraining anyone from personally accepting the
new teaching, particularly any of the nobility. The only
thing it seeks to guard against is the public dissemination of
the new teaching among the common people.</p>

<p>These significant gains stimulated the adherents to the
Reformation and its sympathizers to greater and more open
activity. The new movement, as has already been noted, had
penetrated even into the royal court, and had found followers
among those nearest to the king. The environment of the
Crown Prince had been strongly saturated with the new
ideas, and every effort was made to win the young prince
over to the new cause. Two of his preachers began openly
to denounce the abuses of the church. They were John Koźmiński,
known also as Cosminius, and Lawrence Prasznicki,
called also Prasnicius and Discordia. The latter became very
well known among the Protestants later on.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Their first
public attacks on the church and demands for reform were
naturally of a general character, and that enabled them to
continue their activity at court for some time.</p>

<p>At this time the Protestants began to appeal to the masses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
of the nation through religious literature, published in the
vernacular. The works of Andrew Samuel appeared in the
Polish language, and other heretical books, likewise in the
language of the people, were freely imported and circulated.
Moreover, there were now within the country men who wrote
in the spirit of the Reformation in Polish, and had their
writings printed. Nicholas Rey, the father of Polish literature,
published his first satirical work in 1543. It consisted
of a conversation, in which a gentleman, a bailiff, and a
priest participated, and in which the author severely rebuked
the cupidity of the clergy and the folly of the people for
regarding their payment of tithes as the essence of morality
and religion and for relying on that for their salvation, while
at the same time he pointed out the essential character of
faith. The same year there appeared anonymously from the
press in Cracow the first Polish catechism published in
Poland, in which the new reform doctrines were taught, and
which contained also some of Rey’s verses. Other of Rey’s
writings followed in 1545, 1546, and 1549. In all of these
the writer championed the new doctrines, at first cautiously,
but later quite frankly. In 1544 John Seklucyan published
his Confession of Faith, and somewhat later his Polish translation
of the four Gospels appeared<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> in Königsberg.</p>

<p>This new kind of appeal of the reformers to the people
caused the king to issue from Brześć in Lithuania, July 10,
1544, a threatening mandate to the starostas, stirring them
up to vigilance and to a strict enforcement of the law. Whoever
dared to import, sell, buy, possess, or read such books
was to be punished by death.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>This mandate was the last of the repressive measures issued
by the old king against the Reformation. Owing to his
age and without doubt also to a growing conviction of the
futility of an attempt to stem the tide of ideas and convictions,
especially in the realm of religion, he ceased to combat
the movement with edicts and mandates. In this period of
relative quiet the reform forces gathered new strength and
courage for their great activity in the following reign.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
This inactivity on the part of the king gave rise to rumors
among the opponents of the Reformation that the king was
favoring the spreading heresy. These rumors were given color
by the king’s Order to the Starostas, issued in Cracow, August
9, 1546, to forbid Polish citizens in the king’s name to take
part on either side in the religious war which had broken
out in Germany at this time.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> This order was issued by
the king in spite of the fact that Paul <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, in a letter, dated
July 3, 1546, had urged Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr> to take an active part
in that war on the side of the forces defending the cause of
the church.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>At this time too, the reform movement began to make an
open breach in the ranks of the Roman clergy. The first
notable case was that of John Łaski, known also as John a
Lasco, a nephew of the famous Primate of Poland of the
same name. John Łaski had spent a number of years in
studies abroad, had come into personal touch with the reformers
of Wittenberg and Geneva, had accepted the Reformed
faith, and in 1542 resigned his prebendary of Gnesen.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
In 1541 Andrew Samuel, a Dominican monk, brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
to Posen by Bishop Branicki, a preacher at Mary Magdalene’s
Church and a very learned man and an eloquent
speaker, became a Protestant. In 1543 another Dominican
monk, John Seklucyan, through whose influence Samuel had
been led to accept the new teaching and to preach its doctrines
openly, broke with the Church of Rome, and became
very active in developing a Polish Protestant literature under
the protection and with the aid of Duke Albert of East
Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In 1544, again, Stanislaus Lutomirski, a parish
priest of Konin, became a Calvinist.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Lutomirski’s example
led Felix Krzyżak, known also as Cruciger, prebendary
of Niedźwiedź, to embrace Calvinism in 1546, and through
his influence the magnate Stanislaus Stadnicki was induced
to do the same thing. In 1547 James Sylvius, prebendary
of Chrzęcice, in the possessions of the Filipowskis, also went
over to Calvinism.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the close contact of the court clergy, in great
degree liberal in matters of religion, with the patriciate of
the city of Cracow, for years favorably disposed toward the
new religious movement, helped to promote the spread of the
new doctrines. Beginning in 1545, frequent secret meetings for
purposes of religious and theological discussions were held
in the home of the nobleman John Trzycieski, in which members
of the upper social classes, the town patriciate, the neighboring
szlachta, the court clergy, the canons of the cathedral
chapter, and the king’s secretaries participated. Of the
townspeople we know the name of one, Wojewódka; of the
szlachta, we know names of Trzycieski, Karmiński, James
Przyłuski, Filipowski; of the clergy, Francis Lismanini,
James Uchański, Zebrzydowski, Adam Drzewicki, and Leonard
Słonczewski. The last three became bishops later on,
and one of them, Uchański, archbishop and primate of
Poland, a strong advocate of a Polish National Church. The
promoter and leader of these secret meetings was Francis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Lismanini, a Franciscan monk and private confessor of the
queen. It was chiefly he who procured and distributed heretical
books among the members of this select group, and spread
the new religious ideas among his monastic brethren. In
these meetings outside visitors, stopping temporarily in the
city, also participated. Imbued with the new spirit, the
clerical visitors carried the new doctrines wherever they went,
and preached them to their hearers.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Similar meetings
were being held in Posen, of which Samuel and Seklucyan
were the product.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The growing interest on the part of the people in the
Reformation, the aggressive character of the movement, and
the increasing defections among the clergy created consternation
among the Polish bishops. These high church dignitaries
began now to feel that it was not safe any more to rely
on the lower clergy. The synod of 1547, therefore, charged
the bishops not to allow any priest to preach without a special
permit from the bishop of the given diocese. Bishops
that were careless in observing and enforcing this synodical
ruling were to be fined 100 “grzywień.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Third Period, 1548-1573: Triumph and Dominance.</i>—As
the Reformation in Poland was steadily gathering strength
and growing in influence, King Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr> died on Easter
Sunday, April 1, 1548, and was succeeded by his son Sigismund
Augustus, crowned since 1530 to succeed his father
as king of Poland. Sigismund Augustus was a truly religious
man, believing sincerely in the fundamentals of the
Christian religion, but indifferent to the forms in which they
were to be expressed. He adhered to the Church of Rome as
the state church in which he had been brought up and to whose
forms of worship he had become accustomed. At the same
time he associated closely with Protestants, read Protestant
books, and took part in discussions on theological questions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Calvin, as we have seen, had dedicated his Commentary on
the Mass to him. Among his closest and most intimate
friends were Protestants like Nicholas Radziwill the Black,
grand hetman of Lithuania and brother-in-law of the young
king, and Francis Lismanini, at one time private confessor
of the king’s mother.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the Roman See
and the Polish clergy were considerably apprehensive of the
future of the Catholic Church in Poland, while the Protestants,
on the other hand, looked forward with confidence,
counting on the support of the young king. Just as soon
as the news of the death of the old king reached the Pope,
he at once dispatched to Poland a legate in the person of the
Abbot Hieronimus Martinengo to carry to the young king
his condolences, his congratulations, and his apostolic blessing,
and to secure from him assurances of his loyalty to the
Church of Rome and of his purpose to follow, in religious
matters, in the footsteps of his father. The nuncio arrived
in Poland in August, 1548. The king received him cordially,
assured him of his respect for the Apostolic See, and advising
him not to wait for the meeting of the next Diet, dismissed
him.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The Protestants, too, became now very active, preaching
their doctrines openly, and holding services on the estates
and in the villages of the szlachta. Their forces were strengthened
by the arrival in Poland in the summer of 1548 of the
Bohemian Brethren. They had been expelled from Bohemia
and were on the way to East Prussia, where they were offered
the hospitality of Duke Albert. On their arrival in Posen,
they were cordially received by the Starosta-General of Great
Poland, Andrew Górka, castellan of Posen. During their
stay in Posen they preached publicly, and found many followers.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Ordered by the king, at the request of Bishop
Idźbieński of Posen, to move on, they left; but their brief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
stay prepared the ground for future work, and established
connections which enabled them to return later on.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely had the bishop of Posen freed the city of the
Bohemian Brethren, when he had a new case of heresy to
deal with. The prebendary of St. John’s, Andrew Prażmowski,
began to preach Calvinistic doctrines from the pulpit of
his church. The bishop drove Prażmowski out of his diocese.
However, this did not stop Prażmowski’s activity as a Calvinistic
preacher. Finding refuge in Radziejów, Kuyavia,
and protected there by the powerful magnate, Raphael Leszczyński,
voyvoda of Brzezść and starosta of Radziejów, he
prepared there the ground for the spread of Calvinism, and
laid the foundation for the establishment of the Calvinistic
Church in this voyvodship.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The same thing was happening
in Little Poland, where Lismanini, though now under
the ban of the bishop of Cracow, was nevertheless very active,
spreading Calvinistic doctrines. Catholic priests one after
another began now to leave the Church of Rome, to preach
the Reformation doctrines, and to reorganize their churches
and the form of worship by doing away with the mass and
with pictures and by introducing the cup at communion.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Moreover, the aristocracy openly encouraged the spread of
Protestantism in their possessions. Calvinistic churches
sprang up at Alexandrowice of the Karmińskis, at Chrzęcice
of the Filipowskis, at Pińczów of the Oleśnickis, and at
Secynin of the Szafraniec family.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Karmiński and Filipowski
had been members of the secret circle in Cracow, meeting
for purposes of discussion of the new ideas.</p>

<p>At the Diet of Piotrków, 1547-1548, the szlachta had in
the very first article demanded the preaching of the pure
word of God without any human or Roman admixtures. All
this, however, had been done rather quietly as yet. But now
at the very first Diet, called by the new king to meet in
Piotrków again in 1548, questions of religious reform were
brought boldly to the front. The szlachta demanded freedom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
to speak of God freely in every place, which thing the clergy
forbade. But when the issue was raised in the Senate, the
king replied that to speak of God was the prerogative of the
clergy, and that he would follow them.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>To such an extent had the reform movement spread, that
it became necessary for the Calvinists of Little Poland to
establish a better church organization. In effect they held
the first synod in 1550 at Pińczów, in the possessions of
Nicholas Oleśnicki, a descendant of the famous Bishop and
Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki. Shortly thereafter they appointed
Felix Krzyżak (Cruciger) of Szczebrzeszyn as superintendent
of the Reformed Churches of Little Poland.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> At
the same time the clergy of the Roman Church were becoming
more and more restless. Stanislaus Orzechowski, a canon of
the cathedral chapter of Przemyśl and a man of noble rank,
came out with denunciations of the evils of the church and
with threats of marriage. Immediately a number of priests,
Martin of Opoczyn, Martin Krowicki, Valentine, prebendary
of Krzczonów, and others, proceeded to take wives unto themselves.
In spite of their marriages, some of them still held
to their charges, and argued for a married clergy.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Leonard
Słończewski, who had openly criticized the Pope and the
clergy while preacher of St. Mary’s, Cracow, now bishop of
Kamieniec, preached against Peter’s primacy, the celibacy
of the clergy, and their loose moral lives.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Maciejowski,
bishop of Cracow, though by no means a supporter of the
Reformation, yet favored certain reforms, like the cup at
communion and a married clergy. Francis Stankar, professor
of Hebrew in the University of Cracow, propounded
views of the Trinity which were contrary to those held by the
church. When charged with heresy and arrested by the
bishop, he escaped with the help of the neighboring szlachta,
found refuge at Dubieck in the possessions of the magnate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Stanislaus Stadnicki, established a school there with five
teachers, and continued to disseminate his ideas.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>This state of affairs stirred up the bishops to action. John
Dziaduski, bishop of Przemyśl, having previously warned
Orzechowski, who had married in spite of the warning, proceeded
to try him along with some of the other married
priests; but fearing interference from the szlachta, he condemned
them in their absence without a hearing. Andrew
Zebrzydowski, bishop of Cracow, summoned Conrad Krupka
to justice; and when Krupka appeared accompanied by a
number of friends, the bishop refused to hear him, and condemned
him as a heretic without a trial. Orzechowski being
a nobleman, his verdict had to be confirmed by the king
before it could be executed. The king confirmed the verdict,
and forwarded it to Kmita, starosta of Przemyśl for execution.
Orzechowski was to be deprived of honor, his possessions
were to be confiscated, and he was to be exiled. But
Kmita, knowing the feeling of the szlachta in this matter,
would not execute the verdict.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In the ecclesiastical attack on Orzechowski, the szlachta
saw an attack upon its own special privileges. When Orzechowski
appealed his case to the Diet in 1550, the Diet
took it up readily. The matter created such a commotion
as to cause the Diet to break up without any results.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Instead
of taking due warning, the bishops proceeded to exercise
their authority in a still more high-handed way. In 1551
the bishop of Przemyśl condemned the magnate Stanislaus
Stadnicki for protecting heretics. He did this in Stadnicki’s
absence, without a trial, and against the protests of Stadnicki’s
attorney. The Primate of Poland, Dzierzgowski, archbishop
of Gnesen, showed his zeal by condemning as heretics
Christopher Lasocki and James Ostrorog, two of the most
powerful and distinguished magnates of Great Poland. In
all these cases the bishops did not fail to declare distinctly
that all the property of a condemned heretic was subject to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
confiscation.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The Polish szlachta, regardless of religious
affiliation or sympathies, rose almost to a man in most indignant
protests against such high-handed usurpation of
power on the part of the hierarchy and against such brutal
attacks upon their most fundamental rights. At the provincial
diets in the fall of that year, at which delegates were
chosen to the next Diet, the szlachta voiced their indignation
against the clergy, and instructed the chosen deputies to the
Diet of 1552 to protest against ecclesiastical jurisdiction and
to demand its abolition.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The Diet of 1552 met at Piotrków toward the end of January.
The Chamber of Deputies elected as its president
Raphael Leszczyński, starosta of Radziejów, an avowed Calvinist,
who during the mass at the opening of the Diet stood
in the church with his head covered. He was the chief spokesman
of the injured and aggrieved szlachta. When the Chancellor
had finished reading the appeal from the throne to
consider problems of defense, Leszczyński rose in the name of
the Chamber and the szlachta, stating that the Chamber
would take no action on any matter until the grievances of
the szlachta, arising from the abuse of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
were removed. In this attitude the Protestants were
supported even by loyal Catholics. In the ensuing debate
the bishops were left without any support. The secular
senators, among whom were several very influential Protestants,
sided with the Chamber of Deputies. The leaders of
the opposition to ecclesiastical jurisdiction were: in the Senate,
John Tarnowski, castellan of Cracow and grand hetman
of Poland, a loyal Catholic; in the Chamber, Raphael Leszczyński,
starosta of Radziejów and president of the Chamber,
an ardent Calvinist.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The struggle resulted in the suspension
of ecclesiastical jurisdiction for a year, the szlachta
agreeing to pay the customary tithes, the payment of which
had in many instances already been stopped.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>From 1552 to 1565 the Protestants dominated all the Diets,
electing invariably a Protestant as president of the Chamber
of Deputies.</p>

<p>The united opposition of the Polish szlachta to the Polish
clergy in 1552, the election of an avowed Protestant to the
presidency of the Chamber in that year, and the actual, even
though temporary, suspension of ecclesiastical jurisdiction,—all
this had a most stimulating affect on the religious reform
movement in Poland. Felix Krzyżak and Francis Stankar,
who had fled to Great Poland from the persecution of Bishop
Zebrzydowski in 1551 and had found protection at Ostrorog
in the possessions of Stanislaus and James Ostrorog, returned
now to resume their work in Little Poland.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> For this they
were now all the better qualified as a result of their acquaintance
with the work of the Bohemian Brethren in Great
Poland. They began to hold conferences and synods, thereby
stimulating the interest and enthusiasm of the Protestants
in the reform movement. The Protestant nobles, having
the right of recommending candidates for vacant churches
within their possessions, made now direct appointments of
men sympathetic with the reform movement. In this way
into many of the churches the new form of worship was
introduced. At the same time many of the nobles began
seriously to question the fundamental right of the clergy to
tithes, and stopped payment, even though they had agreed
in 1552 to continue this practice.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> They took these bold
steps, believing that the young king was with them. They
drew that inference from the king’s close intimacy with Lismanini,
who was now an avowed Calvinist, and with others
equally well known for their heretical sympathies and contacts.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>This growing boldness and aggressiveness of the Protestants
provoked the clergy to renewed defensive and offensive
activity. At the synod of Piotrków in 1554 the clergy
were seriously inclined toward conciliatory measures, and after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
a long debate, finally resolved to invite the dissidents and
schismatics to the next synod in an effort to reconcile them
with the Mother Church.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> But they did not stop with that.
They further resolved to appeal to the Pope for help; they
requested the Vatican to send special legates to Poland to
assist the Polish clergy in their struggle against the spreading
heresy, and since the agreement of 1552 was now expired,
they began to make fresh use of their ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
The first one to set the example again was the
archbishop of Gnesen, Dzierzgowski, and his first condemnatory
verdict fell on Stanislaus Lutomirski, who had left the
Church of Rome twelve years before by accepting Calvinism.
Here was another clergyman of noble rank condemned by an
ecclesiastical tribunal as a heretic, and thus deprived of honor,
property, and country. The next one to exercise his jurisdiction
was the bishop of Posen, Czarnkowski, who rendered
verdicts of heresy against several citizens of that city. Dziaduski,
bishop of Przemyśl, continued persecuting heretical
preachers in his diocese. These episcopal condemnations,
however, were of no effect; for the condemned persons always
found protection in the possessions of some powerful magnate,
in whose territory only his own jurisdiction prevailed. In
consequence of this the bishops resorted sometimes to violence
in order to execute their verdicts, though not necessarily
with more success. Bishop Zebrzydowski of Cracow,
for instance, summoned before his episcopal tribunal Martin
Krowicki, who having become a Calvinist, married, left the
priesthood, and was residing at Pinczów, in the possessions
of Stanislaus Oleśnicki. When Krowicki did not appear, the
bishop condemned him without a trial, and planned to seize
him by strategy. Krowicki was taken violently, thrown into
a wagon, and carried away to the bishop’s prison. But when
Oleśnicki was informed of what had happened, he set out
in pursuit of Krowicki’s captors, overtook them, drove them
away, and rescued the victim.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
While the bishops were vainly prosecuting and persecuting
the heretics, the Protestants were steadily strengthening their
ranks by perfecting their organization and by effecting a
very important union of the Calvinists with the Bohemian
Brethren of Great Poland. During his temporary retreat
in Great Poland in 1551, caused by Bishop Zebrzydowski’s
persecution, Felix Krzyżak, superintendent of the Calvinistic
churches of Little Poland, became acquainted with the
Bohemian Brethren there, and invited them to unite with
the Calvinists of Little Poland. After two preliminary conferences
between the representatives of both groups, one held
in Little Poland at Chrzęcice, in the possessions of Filipowski,
and another in Great Poland at Gołuchow, in the possessions
of Raphael Leszczyński, a Protestant synod was called together
to meet at Koźminek, near Kalisz, in August, 1555, at
which time a union between the two above mentioned bodies
was effected. The basis of agreement was that each body
retain its separate organization and its form of worship, while
both were to work toward gradual uniformity in both respects.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The growth of Protestanism and the development of opposition
had made the religious question exceedingly acute, and
placed it at the Diet of 1555 in the very forefront of problems
calling for immediate settlement. The importance of
this question was fully recognized by the king himself, who
had placed it among the matters to be discussed. Encouraged
by the gains made at the Diet of 1552 and provoked by the
high-handed repressive measures employed by the bishops, the
Protestants planned to make a still more determined stand
at this Diet against ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. At the provincial
diets they chose, therefore, some of the most powerful
magnates and most ardent Protestants, like Leszczyński, Ostrorog,
and Marszewski of Great Poland, and Ossoliński, Siennicki,
and others of Little Poland, as deputies of the Chamber.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
The bishops, realizing the seriousness of the impending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
conflict, came out in force, and were ready to make concessions,
if need be.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The Diet, called for the 22nd of
April, 1555, met in first session on the 28th. As could have
been expected, the Chamber again chose a Protestant for its
president in the person of Nicholas Siennicki. In his speech
of welcome to the king on behalf of the Chamber the next
day, Siennicki stated the wishes of the szlachta. In brief,
they wanted the abolition of ecclesiastical jurisdiction and
full religious liberty. A project of adjustment was, therefore,
worked out, having the full approval of the king and the
secular members of the Senate, providing: (1) that everyone
be at liberty to keep at home or at his church such clergymen
as preached the pure Word of God; (2) that these be free
to follow their own ritual and ceremonies; (3) that those
wishing it be allowed to have the communion administered
in both kinds; (4) that priests deprived of their benefices
have them restored for the length of their lives, whereupon
the lords were to be free to choose such priests as they might
wish, or, where the former incumbent was already dead, the
nobles could do as they pleased; (5) that all episcopal judgments
in religious matters against whomsoever issued be declared
null and void; (6) that the clergy be free to marry;
(7) that all the clergy, whatever their rank, be declared entitled
to their former incomes, according to old customs; (8)
that blasphemy against the Trinity and the Eucharist as celebrated
by the Roman Church, attacks upon the form of
worship of that church, and forcible conversions of Catholics
be prohibited; and (9) that all these provisions have the
approval and guaranty of the king and be made binding until
the restoration of universal peace either by a national or a
provincial synod.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>By this document Protestanism in Poland would have been
placed on a basis of full equality with the Roman faith. But
when this bill was presented to the bishops, they promptly
rejected it. Thereupon new plans of adjustment were worked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
out one after another only to be rejected by the bishops.
Finally, it was resolved that the king call together on his
own authority, at a time most convenient in his judgment,
a synod at which the king himself with his council of state
should be present. Until then peace should be preserved in
the country; ecclesiastical jurisdiction against whomsoever
was to be suspended; the execution of all pending ecclesiastical
judgments was to be abandoned; and people were to
refrain from all blasphemies and disturbances growing out
of religious differences.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The bishops, however, remained
inflexible; they would not yield an inch in spite of the fact
that they had considered making concessions. They protested
against the suspension of their ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and
through the archdeacon of Kalisz, Francis Krasiński, appealed
to the Pope for counsel and for help.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the bishops’ protests, the decision
of the Diet prevailed and remained in force. By it ecclesiastical
jurisdiction became suspended until the meeting of a
National Synod to be called together at a convenient time by
the king, and Protestantism was for the time being legally
recognized, receiving full freedom of worship and the legal
right to all the church property already in the hands of
Protestants. It was not as much as the Protestants had
hoped to gain; nevertheless it was a considerable advance and
a marked victory for them.</p>

<p>In accordance with his agreement to call a National Synod
together to settle the existing religious differences, the king
took steps to secure the Pope’s sanction of this move and of
several contemplated reforms. He sent Stanislaus Maciejowski,
castellan of Sandomir and crown court marshal, to Rome
with congratulations to the new Pope, Paul <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr>, and with
the request for his sanction of the following proposed reforms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The mass and all church services to be held in the
Polish language;</p>

<p>2. Communion in both kinds;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
3. A married clergy; and</p>

<p>4. The calling of a National Synod to settle the existing
religious differences and troubles.</p>
</div>

<p>The Pope was astonished at the request, and refused to
sanction the suggested reforms absolutely. To the fourth
point he acceded, but never really intended to keep his promise.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The nature of the proceedings and the decisions of the
Diet of 1555 and the proposed religious reforms for which
the Polish king asked papal sanction caused the Apostolic
See a good deal of concern, and led the Vatican to send at
once Louis Alois Lippomano, bishop of Verona, as special
legate to Poland. From this time on the Apostolic See kept
a special envoy in Poland constantly to watch the course of
events. Lippomano was a man without tact, and not at all
particular in his choice of means to accomplish his objects.
His reputation had preceded him, and his arrival in Poland
in October, 1555, stirred up the Protestant element in the
population to great indignation. The king received him
cordially. But owing to his lack of tact, Lippomano soon
lost the king’s favor, and won the ill-will even of good
Catholics.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>To mend matters, the legate started to exert his influence
first on those nearest to the king. He wrote a letter to
Nicholas Radziwill the Black, palatine, chancellor, and grand
marshal of Lithuania, the most powerful magnate in the
Grand Duchy, an ardent Calvinist, whose zeal contributed
greatly to the spread of Protestantism in Poland as well as
in the Grand Duchy. In this letter Lippomano endeavored
to win and convert Radziwill to the Church of Rome. Radziwill,
however, could not be won back to the Roman Church.
He replied, exposing the unfavorable character of the Catholic
clergy, and let this correspondence be published. The
publication of this correspondence made Lippomano still more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
unpopular in Poland, and changed completely whatever
friendly attitude the king may have had toward him.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Having failed at court, Lippomano turned now to the
bishops to arouse their loyalty and to rekindle their zeal.
But here, too, he failed to meet with better success. Many
of the bishops were ready to capitulate and to negotiate with
the szlachta in order to save their bishoprics and their incomes.
Some of them, like Drohojowski, bishop of Kuyavia,
and Uchański, bishop of Chełm, were actually favorably disposed
toward the reform movement. Others, again, like Zebrzydowski,
bishop of Cracow, owing to past association with
the reformers, were under constant suspicion. The only men
among the Polish hierarchy upon whom the nuncio could
rely were the Primate of Poland, Dzierzgowski, and the bishop
of Warmya, Hosius; and of these two the primate had to be
largely discounted as he had neither the learning nor the
ability to be of any help in such a difficult situation. The
legate had, therefore, no easy sailing to find support for his
plans among the Polish bishops, or to keep them from associating
with heretics.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Seeing the fruitlessness of his efforts among the bishops,
he turned to the lower clergy, visiting churches, holding conferences
with the members of the cathedral chapters and the
parish priests. Here he met with better response and greater
success. He discovered that the lower clergy were both more
loyal and more concerned about the real needs of the church
and the remedies to correct existing evils.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>In this connection it is of interest to note the independence
of the Polish bishops as regards their attitude toward Rome.
A provincial synod under the presidency of the papal nuncio
was called to meet at Łowicz on September 6, 1556. The
Polish bishops wanted to confer <i lang="la">in corpore</i>, without the presence
of the nuncio, and then to present to him the results of
their conference and to get his opinion. The Polish bishops
were opposed to permitting the nuncio to exert undue influence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
on their deliberations, and in this attitude they were
supported even by Hosius, the one Polish prelate upon whom
the nuncio counted most. The nuncio, however, would not
consent to any such procedure in the deliberations. The
disagreement became so acute that Bishop Hosius had to act
as mediator between his colleagues and the legate. Since the
latter would not yield, the bishops finally agreed to confer
together in his presence.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>If the results of the Diet of 1555 made the Apostolic See
vigilant as regards Poland, it is not to be wondered at; for
such vigilance was imperative. The Protestants were now
more active than ever. The Calvinists of Little Poland energetically
developed their work in all the churches occupied
by them before the Diet of 1555 and acknowledged by the
Diet as theirs in the royal cities, particularly Cracow and
Posen, and even in the territories of the royal domain wherever
Protestants were found. They founded schools at Pińczów,
Secynin, and Koźminek. They were holding frequent synods,
and were strengthening and perfecting their internal organization.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
If the Calvinists of Little Poland were active, so
were also the Bohemian Brethren of Great Poland. The
number of their followers increased to such an extent that
by 1557 a separate senior or superintendent for Great Poland
was appointed by the central administrative authority in
Moravia.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Moreover, to counteract Lippomano’s activity,
the Polish Protestants invited to Poland two distinguished
reformers, Francis Lismanini and John Łaski. Both of these
arrived in the country toward the end of 1556. The first,
being a foreigner, the Catholics succeeded in having banished
from the country by order of the king, though not until after
a good deal of effort.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The second, however, being a distinguished
native, could not be banished. So he stayed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
worked faithfully, though fruitlessly, for a union of the Lutherans
with the other two already united Protestant bodies,
the Calvinists of Little Poland and the Bohemian Brethren
of Great Poland.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>When the new Diet, called for November 25, 1556, assembled
in Warsaw, the Protestants were well represented in it.
They came out in full force to counterbalance the presence
and any possible influence of the papal nuncio on the deliberations
of the Diet. The king, being in need of money
for a war which was threatening with the Knights of the
Sword, had to court the favor of the Chamber in order to
get it to vote the necessary contributions for the conduct of
the war. The pressing problems before the new Diet were,
then, those of defense and of religion. According to the
rescript of the preceding Diet, the problem of “egzekucji
praw,” or of the execution of laws, a matter similar to the
English “quo warranto,” which had come up for consideration
at that time and had been postponed until the next Diet,
was to be taken up and considered first. However, it was
decided to lay this problem aside again until a more opportune
time, owing to the more pressing question of adequate
finances for the conduct of the coming war. The Chamber
was ready to vote the necessary contribution, on condition,
however, of a satisfactory settlement of the existing religious
differences. Thus the religious question again became the
most important, and on its solution depended the success of
any program for a proper defense of the country.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> But
no satisfactory solution of the religious problem was in sight.
The Chamber, therefore, proposed that, in case a better adjustment
of the religious differences was impossible at this
time, the decisions of 1555 be continued in force and be more
strictly observed. The spiritual lords were most reluctant
to give their assent to this proposal. The Chamber, again,
threatened that it would not otherwise vote the necessary
funds for the conduct of the war. Hence, the king issued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
an edict, dated January 13, 1557, continuing the religious
settlement of 1555 in force during his absence from the
country, with the added provision that should anyone in any
way violate those decisions, the king would regard such violations
as an offense against his person and against his government,
would judge the offenders in the king’s courts, and
would punish them according to law.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Thereupon the
Chamber voted the needed contribution.</p>

<p>By this edict the king hoped to placate both of the contending
parties. As it happened, the edict did not really
satisfy either party. Consequently it was never made public,
was not enforced, and was finally recalled. However, if it
had been made public, and if it had been enforced, it would
have done away with ecclesiastical jurisdiction; for from now
on cases of heresy, being regarded as an offense against the
king’s person, would have been adjudicated in the king’s
courts rather than by ecclesiastical tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of this turn of events at the Diet of 1556-1557,
the papal legate, Lippomano, immediately left Poland
for Rome. There he complained of the lack of religious fervor
and zeal on the part of the Polish hierarchy, attributing to
their religious indifference the vigorous growth of Protestantism
in Poland, and of the king that he was permitting
everyone to believe and to worship as he pleased.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> His complaint
of the Polish bishops was not altogether groundless.
How little they apparently cared for the spiritual welfare of
the church is shown by their attendance at the synod of 1557,
which met at Piotrków on May 17. Besides the archbishop
of Gnesen, there were present two bishops only, Zebrzydowski,
bishop of Cracow, and Uchański, bishop of Chełm. The other
bishops were represented by their delegates. Moreover, one
of the bishops present, Uchański, asked his colleagues to vote
at the next Diet for the introduction into the Polish church
of communion of both kinds. But the delegates of the cathedral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
chapters opposed this suggested innovation most decidedly,
and turned it down.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Reformation was making steady progress,
not only in the possessions of the szlachta, but also in cities
and among government officials. And owing to the fact that
Protestants were now found among senators, starostas, royal
court officials, and among the king’s most intimate friends,
punishment of heretics was becoming increasingly more difficult.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
In Little Poland the Calvinistic churches had become
so numerous that for administrative purposes they were
divided in 1560 into districts, over which superintendents
were appointed both clerical and lay,—clerical, to care for the
spiritual welfare of the churches, and lay, for the administration
of temporal affairs. At the joint synod of the Calvinists
and the Bohemian Brethren at Włodzisław, on June 15, 1557,
on motion of the distinguished reformer John Łaski, it was
decided that steps be taken to effect a union with the Lutherans,
such as had previously been effected between the
Calvinists of Little Poland and the Bohemian Brethren of
Great Poland.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>At the Diet of 1558-1559, called at Piotrków for November
20, 1558, the Protestants were again in full control,
and for president of the Chamber of Deputies they again
elected Nicholas Siennicki, who presided over its deliberations
in 1555. The foremost problem before the present Diet was
“the execution of laws,” and, of course, inseparably connected
with it was that of religion. Growing out of these, there were
the further problems of the exemption from military service
of the mayors of ecclesiastical villages, ecclesiastical jurisdiction,
and the participation of the clergy in royal elections.
Bishop Uchański moved in the Senate that problems of religion
be set aside until the calling of a national synod, in
which both the clergy and the laity would be free to participate.
He argued that only such an assembly so composed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and gathered for that particular purpose would be able to
adjust the troublesome religious differences. The Chamber
was willing to set matters of religion aside until a national
synod could be called together, but on condition that ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, not only in matters of religion, but in
all matters, with all cases pending, be suspended. Knowing
the seriousness of the situation, yet very reluctant to surrender
their jurisdiction, the bishops pledged themselves to
use it with utmost care. But the new papal legate, Kamill,
bishop of Sutri, refused to countenance any idea of calling
a national synod, to which, besides the Roman clergy, the
laity and the heretics would be admitted. The Chamber, on
the other hand, was equally determined to do away and for
good with ecclesiastical jurisdiction in all matters.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Next, in connection with the larger problem of the execution
of laws, the Chamber questioned the legality of the exemption
from military service of the mayors of ecclesiastical
villages. It was found that according to the Code of Casimir
the Great the mayors of ecclesiastical villages were required
to render military service. The Diets of 1538 and of 1550
confirmed the old law, requiring compliance with its provisions,
unless the clergy produced documentary evidence of
special privileges of exemption for such cases. The Chamber
of 1558, therefore, demanded that the clergy produce the
documentary privileges they claimed to possess,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> but the
evidence was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Thereupon a still more serious question was raised, namely,
that concerning the clergy’s participation in royal elections.
Since the bishops were ever appealing to canonical law rather
than to the law of the land, and since they regarded the interests
of the Church of Rome and their loyalty to the Pope
of greater importance than the interests of the country and
their loyalty to the Polish king, the Chamber through its
spokesman, Hieronimus Ossoliński, a Protestant, argued in
the Senate in the king’s presence that from such a weighty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
matter as the election of a Polish king the bishops, whose
allegiance is divided, should be excluded.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>This proposal capped the climax. It now became fully
evident to all that the difficulties had become practically insurmountable,
and instead of diminishing they were constantly
increasing. The king proposed, therefore, a dissolution
of the Diet. His proposal, being acceptable to all parties,
was put in effect February 8, 1559.</p>

<p>At this Diet the Protestants had been in indisputable control,
and in their struggle with the hierarchy had made considerable
advance. They had demanded the abolition of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction and the appeal to canonical law, not only
in questions of religion, but in all other matters. They had
proved that mayors of ecclesiastical villages were subject to
military service in time of need, and not exempt from it as
the clergy claimed. They had raised the question of the right
of the bishops, as representatives of a foreign potentate, to
participate in the elections of the Polish king.</p>

<p>In the face of the growing strength and aggressiveness of
Protestanism, it is interesting to note the policy of the Catholic
Church toward the state, toward its own clergy, and toward
Protestanism, as that policy is revealed in the decisions of
the synod of 1561. The Polish Catholic clergy fully realized
by this time the precarious position of the Catholic Church in
Poland, and decided upon conciliatory measures. To show
the king their loyalty and generosity, they agreed to make a
liberal contribution, 60,000 thalers, to the king’s treasury
for purposes of defense. To win the people back to the Mother
Church, they resolved on reforms in the life of the Polish
episcopate and the abandonment of the persecution of Protestants.
The bishops were urged to live more simply, to
give more personal attention to the administration of their
dioceses, to establish schools, to assist in the education of the
sons of the poorer gentry by providing free maintenance for
them at their episcopal courts. To reclaim the Protestants,
they resolved now to treat them kindly.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Even the Vatican
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
adopted a conciliatory attitude toward the Polish government
by immediately confirming the king’s appointment to
the archbishopric of Gnesen in 1562 of Bishop Uchański, who
for years had been a suspected heretic and a persona non grata
to the Holy See.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, whenever their incomes were at stake, the
Polish bishops were still quick to resort to their ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, and to excommunicate those failing to pay their
tithes according to the agreement at the Diet of 1555. If
the excommunicated person remained under the ban for a
year without an effort to have it lifted, his property was to
be seized and confiscated. The execution of such episcopal
decrees was not easy; for the civil authorities declined to act.
And even if there were officials who tried to execute such
decrees, they found the task was altogether too difficult to
perform. For instance, Lasocki, a well known Arian Protestant,
failing to pay his tithes to the cathedral chapter of
Cracow, was excommunicated. After a year Chancellor Ocieski,
who was at the same time starosta of Cracow, ordered his
possessions seized. The Protestant nobility, aroused by this
order, came armed, one thousand men strong, to Cracow on
May 14, 1561, and refused to allow the seizure of Lasocki’s
estate.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>This and other similar cases determined the course of action
of the Protestant nobility at the Diet of Piotrków, 1562-1563.
The Protestants were well represented, and again elected one
of their number, Raphael Leszczyński, as president of the
Chamber. They protested now, not only against ecclesiastical
jurisdiction in matters of heresy and tithing, but also
against the edicts issued against heresy by Sigismund <abbr title="One">I.</abbr><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
They appealed to their special privileges received at Czerwińsk
in 1422 and at Jedlnia in 1430, guaranteeing them
freedom of person and inviolability of property rights, and
to the constitution of the Diet of Radom, 1505, which made
the royal edicts against heresy unconstitutional. For that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
constitution, known as <span lang="la">“Nihil novi,”</span> explicitly declared that
no new fundamental law could be passed without the common
consent of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> In
these matters the Chamber again had the full support of all
the temporal peers in the Senate, regardless of creed. As a
result of these protests the king issued instructions to the
starostas to respect the constitutionally guaranteed privileges
of the szlachta. By this act all the edicts against heresy were
practically annulled and the execution of judgments of ecclesiastical
courts, whether in cases of heresy or in case of failure
to pay tithes, was made impossible.</p>

<p>At the next Diet, assembled in Warsaw toward the end of
November, 1563, the clergy made a show of presenting their
privileges, exempting the mayors of their villages from military
service, with the declaration that they were doing it
<span lang="la">“ad informationem”</span> and not <span lang="la">“ad judicum.”</span> The indefiniteness
of the documents was apparent. But the Chamber,
though predominantly Protestant again with Nicholas Siennicki
presiding, was inclined to be conciliatory. It agreed
that the clergy should enjoy personal exemption from the
so-called “pospolite ruszenie,” or general rising in arms, but
it did express the feeling that they should share in the burdens
of defense by money contributions. After several consultations
with the papal legate, the clergy declared their willingness
to make a substantial contribution to the country’s defense
at this time, but could not obligate themselves regarding
the future; and that they would do this on condition that
the law passed at the last Diet virtually doing away with
ecclesiastical jurisdiction be repealed and that the Edict of
Warsaw of 1557, which had then been expressly recalled by
the king as unconstitutional, be enforced. These reservations
and conditions were not acceptable. And when the bishops
refused to recede from the position they had taken, the king
signed a manifesto, imposing a tax of 20 groszen per łan, or
20 groats per hide of land, of which 10 groszen were to come
from the tithes.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> This evoked a veritable furor among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
bishops. But it was useless. The king was firm; and from
now on to the end of his reign whenever a tax was imposed
for purposes of defense, the same proportion was to come
from the tithes.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The notable victories achieved by the Protestants over the
Roman clergy at the last two Diets opened the way wide to
the spread of the Reformation. They also encouraged the
szlachta to go still farther in their efforts to emancipate themselves
from the power of the clergy. With ecclesiastical jurisdiction
practically abolished, the szlachta began now to question
the legitimacy of tithes. They were led to this by the
insistence of the clergy that the tithes be paid, and by continuing
to summon before their courts those who failed to
do so and even the starostas who, in compliance with the
law of the Diet of 1562-1563, refused to execute the verdicts
of their courts. When, therefore, the Diet of 1565 assembled
at Piotrków on January 18, the Chamber under the presidency
of Nicholas Siennicki wanted to know the ground on which
the szlachta was required to pay the tithes and the purposes
for which the clergy were using them. And since the clergy
was unwilling to share the burden of the country’s defense,
the szlachta was disinclined to pay the tithes.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The Deputies
complained also about the summons served by episcopal
courts on the szlachta for non-payment of tithes and on the
starostas for refusing to execute episcopal decrees; whereupon
the king sanctioned a law making all such summons null and
void.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> This was the last blow administered to the effectiveness
of ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and as a result of it the
victory of the Protestants was complete.</p>

<p>An idea of the relative strength and influence of Protestantism
at this time may be gained from the composition of
the Senate in the Diet of 1569, the number of Protestant
parishes in the realm, and from a complaint of Peter Skarga,
the greatest Jesuit preacher in Poland at the close of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
16th and the beginning of the 17th century. The total number
of senatorial seats in the Diet of 1569 was 133. Of these
70 were occupied by Catholics, 15 of whom were bishops, 58
by Protestant dignitaries, 2 by Greek Orthodox senators, and
3 were vacant. Of the total number of senators the Protestants
came close to having one-half, and, exclusive of the
Catholic bishops, the Protestants outnumbered the Catholic
temporal peers by three.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The number of Protestant parishes
in Poland toward the close of the 16th century, according
to Professor Henry Merczyng’s researches and calculations,
was about 600, or one-sixth of the total number of
Roman Catholic parishes in Poland including Lithuania. The
same relative proportion existed between the Protestant and
the Catholic szlachta of Poland at this time.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> That this
estimate of Professor Merczyng’s of Protestant strength in
Poland at this time is very conservative can be seen from
Peter Skarga’s complaint, made at the close of the 16th
century, that two thousand Romanist churches had been converted
into Protestant places of worship.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>To make their strength felt still more politically, the Protestants,
including the Lutherans, the Calvinists, and the
Bohemian Brethren, entered into a certain form of union at
Sandomir, April 14, 1570, known as <i lang="la">Consensus Sandomiriensis</i>.
By this agreement, while each body retained its
organization and form of worship, the three Protestant bodies
pledged themselves to preserve peace and harmony among
themselves and to act together politically.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Due to the
political strength of the Protestants, the Polish szlachta entered
during the interregnum after the death of Sigismund
Augustus into a Pact of Confederation at Warsaw in 1573,
by which religious toleration and equality were legally established
in the realm, and had to be sworn to by every newly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
elected king.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> This marked the climax in the development
of the Reformation in Poland.</p>

<p>The causes of this remarkable development of the Reformation
movement in Poland were not only political, as previous
studies have sufficiently established, but also social and economic.
To show this is the purpose of the present study.</p>

the Order of Teutonic Knights, and twice offered the Bohemian crown
to the Polish King, Wladislaus Jagiello. The Poles and the Lithuanians
had separate colleges of their own at the University of Prague,
established by Queen Hedwig, and Polish youth resorted to that
University in large numbers. Huss corresponded with King Jagiello,
and his close associate, Hieronim of Prague, spent some time in
Poland, spreading his master’s ideas.</p>

in 1534 the Poles were forbidden to resort to foreign educational
institutions; in 1541 the Polish nobles were forbidden to
harbor heretics under penalty of deprivation of nobility rights; and
in 1544 the Polish clergy abroad were ordered to return home under
penalty of deprivation of their benefices (Kubala, Stanisław Orzechowski,

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II</abbr></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Social Causes of the Polish Reformation</span></h4>
</div>


<p class="p2">The phenomenal spread of the Reformation in Poland was
due, first of all, to certain social causes. Among these probably
the most potent were the Renaissance, the art of printing,
the influence of foreign universities, particularly those of
Germany and Switzerland, religious toleration in Poland in
the sixteenth century, and the fact that the new ideas were
accepted, championed, and maintained by the upper classes
of the population, thus giving the Reformation movement a
certain prestige, popularity, and much needed moral and
material support.</p>

<p>As in the West, so also in Poland the way for the religious
Reformation was prepared in a large measure by the Renaissance.
The new learning, together with the new temper of
mind resulting therefrom, reached Poland early in the fifteenth
century, won many enthusiastic followers among the
educated nobility and even among the higher clergy, and exerted
a powerful influence over the minds of the upper classes
in the nation throughout the sixteenth century. Many of the
Polish bishops were ardent admirers of Erasmus, among whom
were Tomicki, Maciejowski, Zebrzydowski, Padniewski, and
Myszkowski. Their episcopal courts as well as those of some
of the Polish magnates, including that of Hetman Jan Tarnowski,
were centres of humanistic culture.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The most notable representatives of the new temper of
mind and exponents of the new ideas were John Ostrorog,
who died in 1501, John Łaski, known also as John a Lasco,
and Andrew Frycz Modrzewski; the first living and writing
in the fifteenth and the second two in the sixteenth century.
In his <span lang="la">Monumentum pro reipublicae ordinatione</span>, published
in 1456, John Ostrorog opposed the Polish king’s humble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
submissiveness to the pope, the payment of annates, the proclamation
in the country of papal jubilees and indulgences
for the purpose of collecting money, contended for the separation
of the Polish church from Rome, and advocated state
control of clerical education.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>John Łaski (1499-1560), nephew of the primate of the
same name, was the most ardent and conspicuous Polish
humanist and patron of humanists before his acceptance of
the Reformation and his break with the established church.
He had spent some time with Erasmus at Basel, purchased
the great scholar’s wonderful library, the use of which, however,
he left to his master until his death, and on his return
home in 1526 became a zealous promoter of humanistic studies
in his own country and the most distinguished patron of a
number of young Polish humanists, among whom were Modrzewski,
Andrew Trzycieski, Rullus, Hosius; the Silesians,
Pyrser, Lang, Ephorinus, Frederick of Freistadt; the Hungarian
Antoninus, the Frenchman Aignan Bourgoin, known
also as Anian, and the Englishman Coxe.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Andrew Frycz Modrzewski (1503-1572) was educated at the
universities of Cracow and Wittenberg, and at the latter institution
he became intimately acquainted with Melanchthon.
On his return to Poland he became secretary to Prince Sigismund
Augustus. In 1546 he joined the Cracow circle of
humanistic religious reformers, to which belonged Andrew
Trzycieski, a fellow student of Modrzewski at Cracow, the
publisher Wojewódka, the jurist James Przyłuski, James
Uchański, deacon of the Cathedral Chapter, later archbishop
and primate of Poland, Zebrzydowski, also deacon of the
Cathedral Chapter and later bishop of Cracow, Lismanini,
the Franciscan confessor of the queen, and others. In 1554
he published in Basel in the establishment of John Oporin
his De republica emendanda, the fourth part of which consisted
of his intended work, De Ecclesia, in which he dealt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
with the problem of church reform. Modrzewski was primarily
a humanist, secondarily an advocate of religious reform.
He strongly favored the establishment of a national
church, independent of papal jurisdiction,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and leaned toward
Calvinism.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>In the first half of the sixteenth century humanism reached
the height of its development and influence in Poland, and
as a result brought about a radical mental and spiritual
change. It freed the individual from the mediaeval burden
of religious and intellectual authority; and while it did in
turn impose new authorities, yet it awakened a sense of criticism,
of intellectual and spiritual inquiry, and of independent
judgment.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This new critical attitude of mind constituted
a well prepared soil for the reception, growth, and development
of the new seed of religious reform. This accounts in
a large measure for the easy and rapid spread of the Reformation
in Poland. In their search for truth the humanists disregarded
the authority of the church, and subjected the established
faith and ecclesiastical order to criticism. Criticism
led, in turn, to rebellion against the dogmas of the church
and its organization.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Another factor contributing to the spread of the Reformation
in Poland was the art of printing. The first printed
book, Gutenberg’s Bible, appeared from the press at Munich
in the year 1455. Ten years later books in the Latin language
were printed in Cracow by a certain Gunther Zainer, who, it
is claimed, had been invited to Cracow by the University.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Later Zainer is said to have removed to Augsburg, where he
was to open a permanent printing establishment.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The
earliest known print struck off in Cracow was a calendar for
the year 1474, <span lang="la">Calendarium anni Domini 1474 currentis</span>, a

copy of which is preserved in the library of the University
of Cracow.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Immediately following this publication there
appeared two editions of <span lang="la">Joannis de Turrecremata Explanatio
in Psalterium Davidi</span>, the first in 1473-1474, the second
in 1475. Until recently this book was regarded as the earliest
publication printed in Poland.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Contemporaneously with
Turrecremata’s work there appeared from the press in Cracow
two other interesting books, namely, St. Augustine’s <span lang="la">Opuscula,
de doctrina christiana, de praedestinatione Sanctorum</span>
(1473-1474), and Franciscus de Platea’s <span lang="la">Opus restitutionem,
usurarum et excommunicationum</span> (1475).<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Books in the Slavic language in cyrilic characters were
printed in Cracow as early as 1491 by a certain enterprising
German printer from Neustadt, Franconia, by the name of
Schwaipolt Fiol.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In 1492 Fiol was summoned before an
ecclesiastical court to be tried for openly expressing heretical
opinions. After that nothing more is heard of his printing
and publishing activity.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The first Polish book was printed
in Breslau in 1475. Its title was <span lang="la">Statuta synodalia Wratislawiensia
episcopi Conradi Oelsnensis, item statuta episcoporum
Petri Nowak et Rudolphi Ruedesheimii</span>, and it contained
in Polish the Lord’s Prayer, Ave Maria, and the Apostles’
Creed. A copy of this book is to be found in the
British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Whatever printing was done in Cracow in the second half
of the fifteenth century was, however, sporadic. Permanent
printing and publishing business had not been established
until the beginning of the sixteenth century. This was first
accomplished in 1503 by John Haller, a merchant of Cracow,
who imported a printer from Metz, Caspar Hochfeder by
name, with all necessary equipment. Chmielowski claims that
Hochfeder was the printer who had previously been in Cracow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
and had printed Turrecremata’s, Augustine’s, and de
Platea’s works, and not Zainer. It is also known that in this
undertaking Haller was assisted by Georg Stuchs von Sulzbach.
From this time on Cracow had a permanent printing
establishment, owned and managed by John Haller. This
enterprising merchant owned also a paper mill and maintained
a bookstore.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> After Haller’s death in 1525 the business
was efficiently carried on by his widow, and merited a
considerable degree of renown.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Encouraged by the example and success of Haller’s enterprise,
others soon entered the publishing business, and the
number of printing presses in Cracow multiplied rapidly.
In the first half of the sixteenth century the Polish capital
was the proud possessor of the printing establishments of
Florian Ungler, Hieronimus Wietor, Matthew Scharffenberger,
Siebeneicher, Wierzbięta, Lazarus Andrysowicz, and
of Piotrkowczyk.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Ungler was the first one of the Cracow
printer-publishers to attempt Polish prints. Among his employees
was a certain John of Sącz (Jan z Sącza), who later
became a very active promoter of Polish printing. In 1533
this John of Sącz, known now also as Małecki and Sandecki,
had a printing establishment in Pułtusk. By 1536 we find
him in East Prussia at first as printer-publisher and afterwards
as Lutheran pastor and superintendent at Elck.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
Ungler’s successors became Stanislaus of Zakliczyn and Gregory
Przeworski.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The largest and best in point of output
and quality of work was the printing establishment of Andrysowicz.
By it were printed the constitutions of the Polish
Diet, Wujek’s Bible, and many other important and valuable
books of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>In the years 1503-1536 there were published in Cracow
alone two hundred ninety-four printed books, or as many as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
in the whole of England in the same period.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Thus, the
Polish capital became the centre of cultural activity, not only
for Poland, but also for eastern and south-eastern Europe.
“The earliest books for Hungary, Moldavia, Transylvania,
Ruthenia, and Lithuania were printed in Cracow.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>But Cracow was not the only Polish city in which printing
establishments were to be found. Other cities had them,
too. In the first half of the sixteenth century printing
establishments were found in Wilno, Pułtusk, and Poznań.
Later, in the course of the second half of the same century,
printing presses were established in Lublin, Brześć-Litewski,
Kowno, Łosk, Nieświez, Łowicz, Płock, Kalisz, Pińczów, Raków,
Zamość, Warsaw, Gdańsk, Chełm, Lwów, Kiev, and
other provincial cities and towns.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, many of the Polish printer-publishers were either
open adherents of the Reformation or in sympathy with it.
Some of the Cracow printers, though remaining in the Catholic
Church, yet for the sake of business printed and circulated
Protestant books. Wietor, suspected of heresy, had to make
a confession of the Catholic faith before an episcopal tribunal.
The printer Andrysowicz was placed on the index.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
Some were open adherents of the Reformation. The court
printer, Michael Wierzbięta, was a Calvinist, an elder in the
Reformed Church of Cracow, and in his establishment were
printed Calvinistic books and pamphlets as well as many of
the best Polish literary productions of the time.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Alexander
Rodecki, another Cracow printer-publisher, conducting
printing establishments also at Raków and at Łosk, was an
Arian. His daughter Judith married Sebestian Sternacki,
who was also a publisher of Arian literature at Cracow and
Raków. Sebestian Sternacki’s son, Paul, married Catharine
Siebeneicher, and continued as publisher of Arian literature.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Other Protestant printers were Daniel of Łęczyca, an itinerant
printer, Bernard Wojewódka, active at Brześć-Litewski,
and Cyprian Bazylik, who married a niece of one of the earliest
Cracow printers, Wolfgang Lerma von Pfaffenhoffen.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Besides a number of printer-publishers, there was in Cracow
and in Poland in general a considerable number of booksellers
thoroughly sympathetic with the Reformation movement.
One of the earliest Cracow booksellers imbued with
the new religious ideas was Georg Fenig, of Crailsheim, Würtemberg.
He had been in Cracow as early as 1515. In 1520
he was in Leipzig, where he had a bookshop and where he
became a Lutheran. In 1527 he returned to Poland, and
settled in Poznań. After his death in 1538 his widow carried
on the business until 1551, when she removed to Königsberg
in East Prussia with her daughter, who married there John
Seklucjan, formerly of Poznań.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Other Cracow booksellers,
favoring the Reformation, were Sebestian Pech, Michael Królik,
Zachaeus Kessner, Jean Tenaud, of Bourges, and Estienne
Le Riche, of Lyon.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Pech and Królik were Calvinists, and
were in constant touch with Geneva, Zurich, and Basel. Just
as soon as a new book was published in Switzerland it at
once found its way to Poland through these intermediaries.
Pech maintained a bookstore not only in Cracow, but also
in Lwów.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The largest Cracow bookseller in the second half
of the sixteenth century, and a very influential member of
the Lutheran congregation there, was Zachaeus Kessner. His
business connections extended throughout Poland and northern
Hungary, and he dealt chiefly in books of scholarly
value.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> John Policjusz, a former business manager of Kessner’s,
became a bookseller at Zamość.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Jean Tenaudus was
a Frenchman and a leading Calvinist, who came into touch
with Polish Calvinists through Geneva. He came to Poland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
in 1558, and was first a teacher in the Calvinistic gymnasium
at Pińczów and later principal of the Calvinistic school in
Cracow, conducting a bookstore at the same time. Owing to
his fame as a bookdealer, he won the honor of being designated
by King Stephen Batory in 1578 as court bookdealer.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Estienne Le Riche, known also as Stephen Dives, of Lyons,
seems to have succeeded Tenaud, and was an important intermediary
in the book business between Poland and the West.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
As a result of this active book trade in Poland in the sixteenth
century, the writings of Luther and Calvin and of
other reformers were speedily imported into Poland and received
wide circulation. As early as 1520 Luther’s books were
brought to Cracow, sold in the university buildings to the
students, and were read and discussed by them with the tacit
approval of the faculty until they were condemned by Pope
Leo <abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr><a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>In the spread of intelligence regarding the new religious
movement the Polish magnates, favoring and supporting the
Reformation, played also an active and important part. A
number of them established printing presses of their own for
the distinct purpose of religious propaganda. Thus, for instance,
Michael Radziwill, the Black, an ardent supporter of
Calvinism, founded a printing press at Brześć-Litewski, where
Calvinistic literature was printed, and where in 1563 the
Radziwill Bible was published. John Kiszka, starosta of
Żmudź, established presses at Łosk and Nieśwież. These together
with Raków and for a time with Pińczów were publication
centres for Arian literature. At Nieśwież in 1572 Budny’s
Arian Bible was published. The presses at Pińczów were
maintained by the Oleśnickis. Moreover, we must not fail
to bear in mind that one of the earliest, most prolific and most
influential Polish Protestant publication centres was Königsberg
in East Prussia, where Prince Albert had established
one of the best and largest printing and publishing enterprises
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
of the time for the dissemination of the Reformation
doctrines both in his own duchy and throughout Poland.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>These Protestant presses were kept busy, printing pamphlets,
books, and the Scriptures or portions thereof. This
literary output consisted partly of translations and partly of
original writings. A good deal of it was polemical, making
a severe attack on Catholicism. What helped to stimulate this
publishing activity was the fact that by a statute of 1539 the
royal edicts of 1520 and 1523, forbidding the dissemination
of heretical literature, were revoked, and freedom of the press
was established in Poland.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> From the presses of Königsberg
John Seklucjan fairly flooded Poland with religious literature
between the years 1544 and 1559. Among his publications
deserving mention there were: A Confession of Christian
Faith, published in 1544, Luther’s larger and shorter catechism
and a collection of hymns (1547), a Polish translation
of the New Testament, effected by Stanislaus Murzynowski
and published in 1550-1553, and Seklucjan’s volume of homilies
(1556).<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Here, too, appeared in 1552 Małecki’s translation
of the New Testament.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> This Małecki is the same
person whom we met before in Cracow and at Pułtusk as
printer-publisher under the name of John of Sącz. Following
Seklucjan’s example, Scharffenberg published in Cracow in
1561 John Leopolita’s translation of the Bible, known as the
Leopolitan Bible. The Calvinistic or Radziwill’s Bible, as
we have already noted, appeared at Brześć-Litewski in 1563,
the Arian or Budny’s Bible at Nieśwież in 1572, and the
Catholic or Wujek’s Bible in 1599.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Among the Protestant
publications of this time deserving mention were also two
significant volumes of homilies, Nicholas Rey’s published in
1557, and Gregory’s of Żarnowiec, which appeared in 1572-1580.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Both of these works have survived in various editions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the vicissitudes of time to the present day, and are still in
use in Protestant homes of Poland. The Arians, too, made
a large and credible contribution to Polish religious literature,
consisting of translations of the works of Stankar, Lismanini,
Ochino, and Socino, and of original writings of their
leading representatives. Among the leading Arian writers of
the sixteenth century were Martin Krowicki, Gregory Paul or
Pauli, Peter of Goniądz, Simon Budny, John Niemojewski,
and Martin Czechowic. Czechowic had studied at Poznań and
Leipzig (1554), and was the most distinguished of the Arian
writers. His most important works were published between
the years 1575 and 1583, his Racovian Catechism appearing
in 1575, his translation of the New Testament in 1577, and
the Epistomium, a polemical work, in 1583.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that the number of books printed in Cracow
alone in the years 1503-1536 was two hundred ninety-four.
The total number of books printed in Poland toward the end
of the fifteenth and during the sixteenth century is estimated
to have been seven thousand five hundred.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> This extensive
printing and publishing activity contributed greatly to the
popularization and spread of the ideas of humanism and the
doctrines of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Then, too, the spread of the new ideas in Poland was due
to close intellectual connections between Poland and the West
and to the influence of German and Swiss universities. It
was customary for the sons of the Polish aristocracy and the
well-to-do gentry to frequent foreign universities for the purpose
of rounding out their education. The leaders of that day,
whether in science, literature, or politics, were invariably men
educated abroad. Moreover, visits home on the part of the
Polish students, regardless of whether they were studying in
Germany, Switzerland, or Italy, were more common and frequent
in the sixteenth century than today.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The University of Cracow, famous for its learning, attracting
students from all over Europe, and flourishing in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
fifteenth century, lost its influential position and its drawing
power with the beginning of the sixteenth century, owing to
its reactionary character and its pronounced opposition to
the new current of thought and learning. The universities
of the West and of the South superseded it in influence and
attractiveness. The flow of foreign students to Cracow ceased;
and Polish students began to turn now more and more to
German, French, Swiss, and Italian universities in search
of learning and knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Up to 1525 the sons of distinguished
Polish families still frequented the University of
Cracow, spending their first years there and then finishing
their studies in universities abroad. After that, however,
the character of the student body at the university changed
entirely. The sons of the Polish aristocracy disappeared;
they turned to other universities. The names appearing on
the university register after 1525 were names of the small
gentry, the town population, and the peasantry.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The youth
of the Protestant families in particular had nothing to gain
by registering at the University of Cracow; it, therefore,
sought the universities of Wittenberg, Zurich, and Basel, especially
so by the middle of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The Polish students were eager to become acquainted with
the new ideas, they absorbed them readily, and on their visits
home or their final return they disseminated them in their
own country. So great was the exodus of Polish students to
German and other foreign universities, and so great the danger
of infecting the country with the new religious doctrines
and practices through the channel of intellectual intercommunication
that the reactionary elements in the country found
it necessary to force the king to pass laws forbidding the
Polish youth to frequent foreign universities infected with
heresy or suspected of such infection.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>It is of great interest to note that in the sixteenth century
Polish students were registered in considerable numbers in
nearly every German and Swiss university of any consequence.
They were at Wittenberg, Leipzig, Königsberg,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Frankfort
on the Oder, Heidelberg, Herborn, Altdorf, Marburg, Freiburg,
Würzburg, Dillingen, Mainz, Ingolstadt, Zurich, and
Basel.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The German universities most largely attended by
Poles were Wittenberg, Leipzig, Königsberg, and Frankfort
on the Oder. The number of Polish students registered in
these institutions of learning in the course of the sixteenth
century was over two thousand.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> At Heidelberg there were
in the course of the century about one hundred and sixty-five
Polish students,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> at Altdorf, from its foundation in 1575
until 1617, two hundred and seventy,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> at Marburg, from
1527 to 1628, about seventy,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and at Basel, from 1549 to
1570, also about seventy.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> At Wittenberg we find representatives
of prominent Cracow families among Luther’s students
as early as 1520.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> By the end of the same decade the
number of Polish students in that university had considerably
increased, and there were found among them Stanislaus Orzechowski,
Stanislaus Warszewicki, I. Krotowski, I. Lipczyński,
three Górkas, two Ostrorogs, Tomicki, and Grudziński.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
After 1530 the sons of the Polish nobility flocked to Wittenberg
in steadily growing numbers.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The universities most popular with the Poles were the Protestant
universities rather than the Catholic. The relative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
proportion of Poles attending German Protestant and Catholic
universities was, in the sixteenth century, six to one.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
The most popular Catholic university was Ingolstadt, registering
in that century three hundred and sixty-five Polish
students and occupying the fifth place among the German
universities frequented by Poles.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Freiburg in the course
of fifty-six years, from 1575 to 1631, during a period when
the Catholic reaction had already set in, registered less than
a hundred Polish students.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Dillingen, Würzburg, Mainz,
founded by Catholic bishops for the purpose of counteracting
the influence of the Protestant universities and under the
control of the Jesuit Order, began to draw Polish students
with the rise of the Catholic reaction after 1564.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Of the
Protestant universities the most popular with the Poles were
Wittenberg, Königsberg, Heidelberg, and Frankfort on the
Oder,—all centres of Lutheranism. Of the Swiss universities
the one most largely attended by Poles was the University of
Basel. The Swiss universities together with Altdorf, Herborn,
and Marburg in Germany were centres of Calvinism,
and were sought and frequented by Calvinistic sympathizers
from among the Poles.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> At Altdorf, where the number of
students was comparatively small, the Poles constituted in
some years one-fourth of the total student body. Owing to
their numerical strength, the honorary rectorship of the university
was held twice by one of their number, in 1583-1584
by Nicholas Ostrorog, and in 1609-1610 by Adam Sienieński.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The Polish students registered in the German and Swiss
Protestant universities were the sons of the Polish aristocracy
and the well-to-do Polish gentry.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> At Altdorf, for instance,
we find the sons of such Calvinistic aristocratic families as
the Firleys, the Ostrorogs, the Naruszewiczes, the Wollowiczes,
the Lanckorońskis, the Wiśniowieckis, the Krotowskis,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
and the Sienieńskis; of the Calvinistic well-to-do gentry,
namely, the Gołuchowskis, the Reys, the Przecławskis, the
Lipskis, the Czernows, the Grochowskis, the Balls, the Boguszes,
the Zielińskis, the Ossolińskis, the Przyjemskis, the
Pieniążeks, and the Suchorabskis; and later, with the beginning
of the seventeenth century, of such Arian noble families
as the Przypkowskis, the Stoyeńskis, the Lubienieckis, the
Otwinowskis, the Filipowskis, the Dudyczes, the Hoyskis, the
Niemieryczes, the Taszyckis, the Morsztyns, the Szlichtyngs,
and even the Radziwills.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> At Herborn, in the years 1611-1619,
there were the Ostrorogs, the Gołuchowskis, the Drohojewskis,
and the Rożyckis. These, too, were sons of Calvinistic
families.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> At Marburg, in the years 1601-1620, we
find representatives of the Lithuanian Calvinistic szlachta
from around Słuck and Kieydany, the Swięcickis, the Rekuckis,
the Ceraskis, the Estkos, the Kozdryns, and the sons
of Calvinistic pastors, the Wannowskis, Krosniewieckis, and
the Molesons.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> At Wittenberg, Leipzig, and Frankfort on
the Oder there were to be found the sons of the powerful
aristocratic families, the Mniszeks, the Ostrorogs, the Lanckorońskis,
the Myszkowskis, the Radziwills, and the Przyłęckis.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
Finally, at Basel we find in the years 1549-1570
representatives of the best and most influential Polish families.
From Great Poland there were the sons of the Zbąskis,
the Ostrorogs, the Rozrażewskis, the Nadarzyckis, the Łasickis,
and of the Woynowskis; from Little Poland, the
Myszkowskis, the Dłuskis, the Gnoyeńskis, the Lipnickis, the
Ossolińskis, the Czyzowskis, the Pieniążeks, and of the Słupeckis;
from Mazovia, Iłowski; from Lithuania, Skumina,
Tyszkiewicz, Kiszka; from Kuyavia, Zebrzydowski; from
the district of Sieradz, the Lutomirskis, Zalewski, Kotkowski,
Paklepka; from the eastern provinces, Drohoyowski, Strzelecki,
Drzewińiski, Strzechowski, and Uhrowiecki.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> All these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
names found on the register of the University of Basel are
well known in connection with the Reformation movement
in Poland. The bearers of them played prominent rôles in
Polish politics and in the spread of the Calvinistic and later
of the Arian faith in their native land.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Another significant cause furthering the spread of the Reformation
in Poland was Polish religious tolerance. In the
sixteenth century Poland was a country not only of political
liberty, but also of intellectual freedom and of religious liberty.
To be sure, owing to the pressure exerted by the clergy
upon the kings, royal edicts, forbidding the dissemination of
the new doctrines in the land and imposing severe penalties
upon transgressors, were issued freely. However, these edicts
violated constitutionally guaranteed liberties of the nobility,
and, consequently, were never approved by any diet; hence,
they had not the force of law, and remained largely a dead
letter.</p>

<p>As to the attitude of the kings themselves, they were rather
tolerant of differences in religious belief and practice. Sigismund
the Old, while a very good and loyal Catholic and
a ruler who seemed to be easily induced to issue decrees proscribing
the new religious movement, was very tolerant personally.
When Johann Eck, the German Catholic theologian
and zealous opponent of Luther, called on him to adopt a
stern policy and to use severe measures in suppressing Lutheranism
in Poland, the king replied that his desire was
to rule over the goats as well as over the sheep.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> When,
again, in July, 1546, Pope Paul <abbr title="Three">III</abbr> urged him to take an
active part on the side of the cause of the church in the
religious war which had broken out in Germany at this time,
Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr> not only refused to do so, but also by royal order
forbade Polish citizens to engage even privately in any way
on either side of the German controversy and conflict.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Then, too, it was Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr> who in 1525 consented to the
secularization of the Teutonic Order and of the Duchy of
East Prussia, then a part of the Polish kingdom. And it is
a well known fact that his court was unusually liberal and a
safe shelter for humanists and humanistic sympathizers with
the Reformation movement.</p>

<p>If Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr> was tolerant, his son, Sigismund Augustus,
who succeeded his father to the throne in 1548, was still more
so. Reared in the liberal atmosphere of the court and educated
by humanists in sympathy with the ideas and doctrines
of the Reformation, Sigismund Augustus was a religious
liberal. Out of state policy he remained in the Catholic
Church and stood by it, though to all appearances his personal
convictions and sympathies leaned in the direction of
the Reformation movement, certainly so in his earlier if not
in his later years. He surrounded himself with humanists
and with supporters of the Reformation. He read books of
the reformers, participated in religious discussions with his
friends, and corresponded with Calvin. He formed an intimate
friendship with Nicholas Radziwill, the powerful magnate
and grand hetman of Lithuania, and an avowed and
staunch Calvinist, and married his beautiful sister, Barbara,
who, too, had embraced the Calvinistic faith. With Franciscus
Lismanini, the former Franciscan confessor of his queen
mother, he maintained a friendly connection for years, even
after Lismanini had become openly known as an ardent admirer
and sympathizer with Calvinism. He favored certain
church reforms, and had gone so far as to send an embassy
to Rome to secure the pope’s sanction of them, which sanction,
however, was not granted. And when at one time the Pope
urged him to exterminate the heretics from his land, Sigismund
Augustus gave the Holy Father this characteristic
reply: “I fear that by trying to pull up the tares, I might
uproot the wheat also.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>The same religious broad-mindedness, liberality, and tolerance
characterized the person and the reign of the third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
notable Polish king of the sixteenth century, Stephen Batory
(1576-1586). King Stephen was a faithful Catholic, a generous
supporter of Jesuitism, and a ruler who saw the strength
of the royal power in a close alliance with the Church of
Rome. Yet, in spite of his strong Catholic loyalty, he would
not tolerate any religious persecution. He steadily discountenanced
all religious disturbances, and firmly kept his coronation
oath to maintain peace among the adherents of different
religious faiths, asserting that he did not wish to
violate anybody’s conscience.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> He, too, like Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr>,
wished to rule peaceably over the goats as well as over the
sheep.</p>

<p>When we turn from the kings to the nation, we meet with
the same broad-minded liberality and tolerance. The Polish
nation of the sixteenth century loved liberty no less than at
any other period of its history. Liberty constituted the
foundation and was an essential characteristic of all its institutions,
political and social. The Polish nobility worked and
fought strenuously for its political rights and privileges, and
having secured them, guarded them jealously. Naturally,
therefore, when the question of religious liberty once arose,
the Polish nobility immediately applied to the sphere of religion
the same principle it had established in the realm of
politics. It insisted on freedom of thought, on liberty of
conscience, on toleration of divergent views, beliefs, and practices.
In 1539 freedom of the press was established, and in
1556 full liberty of conscience.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> To secure the realm still
further against any possible religious intolerance, dissensions,
persecutions, or strifes and conflicts, the ruling classes entered,
on the death of Sigismund Augustus, into a compact,
sealed by the Confederation of Warsaw on the twenty-eighth
day of January, 1573, mutually pledging themselves to maintain
religious peace and toleration in the land.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> This compact
was confirmed by the Diet, became a part of the Polish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
constitution, and had to be sworn to by succeeding kings on
their accession to the Polish throne.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Owing to this remarkable degree of religious toleration,
Poland became a land of refuge for persecuted religious dissenters
and reformers of other European countries. Here
found refuge such men as Franciscus Stankar, Blandrata,
Negri, Lelio and Faustus Sozzino, Bernard Ochino, Alciati,
Gentilis, Franciscus Lismanini, and Peter Statorius,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> all of
whom were Italians of extreme religious views and unwelcome
even in Switzerland; and later at the beginning of the seventeenth
century the German anti-trinitarians, Crell, Smalz,
Ruarus, and Stegmann<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> also found refuge in Poland. Bernard
Ochino, driven out from Zurich, came to Poland in
December, 1563, and in appreciation of the freedom of
thought and of conscience there existing, dedicated his twenty-eighth
dialogue to King Sigismund Augustus. Ochino had
opposed the execution of Servetus, and admired Poland’s religious
toleration.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Ruarus was led to emigrate to Poland
by the reports of its “golden liberty of conscience established
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
by the constitution of the Estates and sworn to by Polish
kings.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Besides these extremists, others sought and found
refuge in Poland from religious persecution in their homelands.
The most notable case is that of the Bohemian Brethren.
While as a group they were ordered to move on to
East Prussia, where Duke Albert offered them asylum, many
of them remained in Poland, and exerted a powerful influence
on the Reformation movement in that country. Moreover,
at Cracow, Vilna, Posen, Tarnov, and Lublin there actually
existed Protestant congregations composed not only of Germans,
but also of Italian, French, English, and Scotch religious
refugees.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The Scotch congregations were naturally
Calvinistic, and some of them were still in existence by the
middle of the eighteenth century. Such names as Gordon,
Hyson, Sinclair, Pipe, Leigh, French and Ross still appeared
on the Calvinistic rolls at that time.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>In this connection it is worth noting that while in liberal
England hundreds of persons were executed for their religious
convictions in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, in Poland there was only one such execution,
that of an eighty year old lady in the city of Cracow
in 1539.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The remarkably rapid spread of the Reformation in Poland
was, therefore, due in no small measure to Polish religious
toleration.</p>

<p>Finally, in our study of the social causes of the growth
of the Reformation in Poland, we must by no means overlook
the fact that the Polish religious reformation was a class
movement. It was accepted, adhered to, and championed by
the upper classes of Polish society; in the cities by the
commercial population, largely German, and throughout the
country by the nobility, the large magnates and the well-to-do
gentry, particularly the large magnates. This was due
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
to the circumstance that both of these classes were in close
contact with the outside world and with new movements
abroad; the first chiefly through commercial intercourse, the
second through educational, social, and diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>This class aspect of the movement was both its strength
and its weakness. The fact that the Reformation won to
itself, and was accepted by, the most alert, socially most influential,
and politically most powerful classes constituted its
strength. It lent the movement a certain dignity and prestige,
made it unavoidably popular, and assured to it rapid
spread and certain victory. In its strength, however, lay
also its weakness. The Polish Reformation remained an
upper class religion. It did not filter through down to the
masses of the population; it did not grip, transform, and
revitalize the people. This circumstance harbored the movement’s
inevitable doom from the very beginning, however
glorious that beginning might have been and however phenomenal
the development.</p>

<p>The Renaissance, the art of printing, the influence of foreign
universities, religious toleration, and the aristocratic
character of the Polish Reformation,—these were, then, some
of the most important social causes of the growth of the
Reformation in Poland.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III</abbr></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Wealth of the Polish Church in the XVIth
Century: Its Effect on the Nobility</span></h4>
</div>


<p class="p2">One of the most potent causes of the spread of the Reformation
in Poland in the sixteenth century was the enormous
wealth of the Polish church. Owing to the liberality of
princes, kings, magnates, and pious devotees, the church became
a great economic power. Its large landed estates and
great financial resources were both exasperating and enviable.
It was one of the largest landowners in the country. Its
financial resources were greater than those of the crown. It
happened not infrequently that the king had to come to the
powerful church dignitaries to ask them for financial contributions
to the state treasury for purposes of government
and defense. By the side of the baronial estates and princely
incomes of some of the Polish bishops the wealth of even
the most powerful magnates faded into insignificance.</p>

<p>In Great Poland, out of a total of 33,000 “łanów
kmiecych,”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> or hides of land under peasant cultivation, the
church was in possession of 3,430 łanów or of 10.33 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
In some districts and palatinates the estates of the church
were more concentrated than in others. In the Palatinates
of Poznań and Kalisz, for instance, they formed only 6 per
cent. of the total land area under peasant cultivation, while
in the Palatinate of Inowrocław they rose to 12 per cent., in
the Palatinate of Brześć to 16 per cent., and in the Palatinate
of Łęczyce to 22 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>In Little Poland, out of a total of 5,455 villages and 205
towns, the church owned 772 villages, 83 sections, or parts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of villages, and 28 towns.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Allowing 5.3 villages to a square
mile, the proportion then prevalent, 2 sections to a village,
and a quarter of a mile to a town, we find that the landed
property of the church in Little Poland in the sixteenth century
covered an area of 160 square miles in a total of 1,013
square miles, and constituted about 15.5 per cent. of the total
estimated land area of the province.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> This property was
about equally divided between the secular clergy and the
monastic orders, the former owning 360 villages, 65 sections,
and 12 towns, and the latter 372 villages, 18 sections, and
16 towns.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Fully one-half of the ecclesiastical lands in Little
Poland,—388 villages, 49 sections, and 9 towns, or between
440 and 450 landed estates,—were located in one palatinate,
namely, that of Cracow.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Mazovia had an area of 578.3 square miles, 5,990 villages
numbering 23,361 hides of land under peasant cultivation,
and 94 towns. The church here was in possession of 15 towns
and 505 villages comprising 5,849 hides of land. This was
16 per cent. of the towns, 8.7 per cent. of the villages, and
25 per cent. of the land under peasant cultivation.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The
church lands in Mazovia were very intensively cultivated; for
while the general proportion of “łanów kmiecych” to a Mazovian
village was only 3.9, within the area of ecclesiastical
estates the proportion was 11.5.</p>

<p>The Palatinate of Podlasie consisted of an area of 173.72
square miles, and numbered in the sixteenth century 1,304
villages, 26 towns, and 14,455 <span lang="pl">“włók wiejskich,”</span> or village
hides of land.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Of the 1,304 villages 30, or 2.3 per cent.
containing 678.75 <span lang="pl">“włók wiejskich,”</span> or 4.7 per cent. of the
total acreage under village cultivation, were in possession of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the Roman Catholic clergy.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> The apparently small landed
property here of the bishopric and the cathedral chapter of
Łuck was further supplemented by various income producing
privileges like fishing rights, rents, and tolls. For instance,
besides his lands the bishop of Łuck had the right to maintain
and operate a <span lang="la">“liburnam et navigium”</span> on the River Bug
near the town of Drohiczyn. On account of its productiveness
the operation of this ferry became a bone of contention
in 1570 between Christopher Iwanowski and the bishop.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>In Volhynia the bishopric of Łuck owned several tracts
of land numbering 14 villages with an area of 2.77 square
miles, and the cathedral chapter of Łuck was in possession
of 5 additional villages of 64 hides of land, covering an area
of 0.8 of a square mile.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Besides the Latin bishopric of
Łuck, there were in Volhynia two Greek Orthodox bishoprics,
Łuck and Włodzimierz. The two owned together good sized
landed estates. The figures for the totals are lacking. But
one of the estates of the Greek Orthodox bishop of Łuck numbered
6 villages of 33 hides of land. The estates of the bishop
of Włodzimierz consisted of two sections, including 13 villages
and 1 town and covering an area of 4.38 square miles.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In
Podolia the estate of the bishop of Kamieniec consisted of
13 villages and 1 town and had an area of 2.4 square miles.
This was further supplemented by a few other smaller properties.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>When we come to Red Russia, we find that in that part of
Poland the landed property of the church was composed of
98 villages and 8 towns, forming 3 per cent. of the total land
under peasant cultivation in Red Russia.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Here most of
the ecclesiastical lands were located in the “Ziemie” or districts
of Sanok, Lwów, and Halicz. In the first they made
up 5 per cent. of the total peasant cultivated lands, in the
second 4 per cent., and in the third 3 per cent., although in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the districts of Lwów and Halicz they maintained a percentage
of four.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>In Ukraina by far the most extensive and the best located
estates were those of the Latin clergy. The largest contribution
in the nature of a land tax paid into the Commonwealth
Treasury in 1581 was that of the cathedral and the cathedral
chapter of Wilno, 158 and 133 Polish florins respectively.
The only other large land owners, approaching anywhere near
the clergy, were the Wiśniowieckis and the Kmitas, the former
paying a contribution of 110 złp. and the latter of 90 złp.
All the rest averaged only 35 złp.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that the Polish church belonged
in the sixteenth century to the class of large property owners.
Even in the eastern provinces of Podlasie, Volhynia, Podolia,
Red Russia, and Ukraina, where its lands constituted a
smaller percentage of the total land area cultivated by peasants
than in the western provinces, the ecclesiastical estates
were invariably large. Compared with the individual holdings
of the Polish nobility and even of the crown, the estates
of the bishops, cathedral chapters, and monastic institutions
were everywhere baronial.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>To get a still clearer idea of the extent of the landed property
of the church in sixteenth century Poland, it will be
well to look at it a little more closely in the various sections
of the country and compare it with that of the crown and
of the nobility. We have seen that in Great Poland the church
owned 10.33 per cent. of the land under peasant cultivation,
in Little Poland 15.5 per cent. in Mazovia 8.7 per cent. of
villages and 25 per cent. of <span lang="la">“łanów kmiecych,”</span> in Podlasie
2.3 per cent. of villages and 4.7 per cent. of “włók wiejskich,”
and in Red Russia 3 per cent. of the land under peasant cultivation.
For Volhynia, Podolia, and Ukraina the figures are
very incomplete, and consequently the approximate proportionate
amount of church property unknown. But judging
by the size of some of the ecclesiastical estates we have observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
in these palatinates, it is safe to infer that the percentage
of church property in them was not smaller than in
the immediately adjoining provinces.</p>

<p>Turning our attention now to the crown lands, we discover
that in the most important sections of the country they
were considerably smaller than those of the church. In Great
Poland the crown lands constituted only 9 per cent. of the
total property under peasant cultivation,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> in Little Poland
7.5 per cent.,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> in Mazovia 4.6 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> From this it is
evident that in Little Poland and in Mazovia the landed
property of the church was more than twice as large as that
of the crown. In Great Poland, taken as a whole, the disproportion
was not quite as striking; yet in the Palatinate
of Łęczyce, where the crown lands formed only 9 per cent.,
those of the church were more than twice as large, 22 per
cent.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> In Podlasie the crown lands gained in size, assuming
a proportion of 19.4 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> But in Volhynia and
Podolia they were very small in the sixteenth century; in
fact, compared with the estates of the church and the secular
aristocracy in these provinces, the royal estates were very
insignificant there.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> This disproportion was somewhat made
up in Red Russia, where the crown lands comprised 22 per
cent. of the total area under peasant cultivation,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> while those
of the church formed only 3 per cent. This comparison
reveals clearly the fact that only in two provinces, Podlasie
and Red Russia, the royal lands occupied a more favorable
position in respect of size than those of the church. In all
the other provinces of the country the landed property of
the church was larger, in some decidedly larger, than that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
of the crown. This, as we shall see later, had a very important
bearing on royal and state finances, the problem of
defense, and the attitude of the Polish nobility toward the
church and its clergy. The economic implications in this
matter were deeprooted and farreaching.</p>

<p>The individual possessions of the Polish bishops, abbots,
and cathedral chapters were, by the side of those of the Polish
nobles, princely. Speaking generally, they surpassed in size
the estates of the secular magnates. The cathedral chapter
of Lwów, for instance, had a landed estate of 10 villages,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
that of Łuck of 5 villages comprising 64 <span lang="pl">“łanów kmiecych”</span>
and covering an area of 0.80 of a square mile,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and that of
Gniezno of far greater proportions.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The landed estate of
the cathedral chapter of Cracow consisted of 46 villages, 14
sections, and 1 town.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The endowments of monastic institutions
were on the whole, of even greater proportions. The
monastery of Trzemesz in Great Poland was endowed with
40 villages comprising 200 <span lang="pl">“włók chłopskich.”</span><a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> In Little
Poland the number of monastic institutions was very large,
and they were all well provided for. The Abbey of Tyniec,
the oldest in the country, possessed 44 villages, 4 sections,
and 5 towns; the convent of the Klarysek at Sącz, 48 villages;
the monasteries of Miechów, 42 villages, 2 sections, and 1
town; Pokrzywnice, 29 villages, 1 section, and 1 town; Łysa
Góra, 21 villages, 1 section, and 2 towns; Sieciechów, 21 villages,
1 section, and 1 town; Jędrzejów, 20 villages, 1 section,
and 1 town.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> In Mazovia, the Abbey of Płock was in possession
of 20 villages, and the Abbey of Czerwieńsk of 63 villages.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Especially striking as to size were the episcopal estates. The
bishop of Poznań owned in the county of Poznań 16 per
cent. of the land under peasant cultivation, in Mazovia, 19
villages, and in Little Poland, 3 villages.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The bishop of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Łuck owned in Podlasie 100 <span lang="pl">“włók osiadłych,”</span> besides “liburnam
et navigium” on the River Bug near Drohiczyn, and
in Volhynia 14 villages covering an area of 2.77 square
miles.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The estate of the bishop of Kamieniec in Podolia
consisted of 13 villages and 1 town, covering an area of 2.40
square miles, besides a number of other smaller tracts of
land.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The bishop of Chełm had 11 villages, 3 towns, and
other minor real estate properties. This last estate was evidently
a very small episcopal estate; for as late as the beginning
of the eighteenth century the bishop of Chełm was regarded
as <span lang="la">“a sola paupertate commendabilis.”</span><a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> The bishop
of Przemyśl was lord of 18 villages and 3 towns, and the archbishop
of Lwów of 29 villages and 5 towns.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The wealthiest
of the Polish prelates were the archbishop of Gniezno, primate
of Poland, and the bishops of Płock and Cracow. The archbishop
of Gniezno was grand lord of 200 villages; 30 in the
county of Gniezno, 20 in the Palatinate of Łęczyce, and 130
in Mazovia in the Palatinates of Rawa and Mazovia, covering
20 square miles.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The bishop of Płock was the owner of
the most extensive landed possessions in Mazovia. His estate
consisted of 232 villages and 6 towns.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> The landed estates
of the bishop of Cracow were the most extensive, numbering
from 280 to 300 villages and covering an area of from 50 to
70 square miles.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Excepting the royal lands, the largest estates, whether in
Great or in Little Poland, were those of the bishops or monastic
institutions. They completely overshadowed the estates
of the Polish nobility. Two-thirds of the landed estates
of the nobility of Great Poland consisted of one village
each. Even the magnates of Great Poland had comparatively
small possessions. Large estates were exceptional in Great
Poland, and they were either royal or ecclesiastical.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Mazovia the only large land owners were the king and the
clergy. There was absolutely no magnate in the entire duchy
equal in wealth to the bishop of Płock. In fact, outside of
the clergy, there were no magnates in Mazovia.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Nor was
there a magnate in Little Poland equal as a landlord to the
bishop of Cracow. The wealthiest of them, Prince Constantine
Ostrogski, could boast of only 80 villages, an estate one-fourth
the size of that of the bishop of Cracow. The next
wealthiest aristocratic family, the Jordans, were lords of only
33 villages, the Zborowskis, 30, the Komorowskis, 29, the
Szafraniec family, 22, and the rest had 10 to 20 villages each.
To equal the landed property of the bishop of Cracow, it
would have been necessary to combine the estates of ten
wealthiest and foremost aristocratic families of Little Poland,
whose combined properties numbered 292 villages, about the
number of those of the bishop.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Viewed in the light of
their landed property, the Polish bishops were not only ecclesiastical,
but also secular princes. In fact, a number of them
bore princely titles. The archbishop of Gniezno and primate
of Poland was prince of Łowicz; the bishop of Warmia was
at the same time prince of Warmia; the bishop of Cracow
was prince of the Principality of Siewiersk; the bishop of
Płock was prince of Pułtusk; and the prebendary of Płock
was prince of Wieluń.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>These princes of the church were also in the habit of leaving
princely private fortunes to their relatives. Many Polish
aristocratic families, like the Oleśnickis, the Myszkowskis, the
Rytwianskis, the Górkas, and the Łaskis, owed their great
wealth and power to having been left large fortunes by some
of their ancestors who had occupied high offices in the
church.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki and Peter Myszkowski,
both bishops of Cracow at different times, were notable
examples in this particular. Peter Myszkowski, born in 1505
and educated abroad at Padua, on his return home received
a large number of benefices, the canonries of Cracow and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Gniezno, the prebendaries of Gniezno, Płock, Łęczyca, and
Poznań, and the deanery of Cracow, so that he was called
“the prebendary of the whole of Poland.” In 1563 he was
appointed under-secretary of state, and at the same time coadjutor
of the bishop of Płock. In 1568 he became bishop
of Płock and in 1577 bishop of Cracow. In the last named
office he remained for fourteen years until his death in 1591.
He left his nephews a private fortune of 8,000,000 Polish
florins, besides large landed estates purchased from the Oleśnickis.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
One of his successors in office, Andrew Lipski, dying
in 1630 as bishop of Cracow, left a private fortune of 900,000
ducats, not counting any real estate property. John Kuczborski,
bishop of Chełm, left in 1623 in cash alone 500,000
ducats. In this connection let us recall that the bishop of
Chełm was regarded as the poorest of the Polish bishops,
and held up as an example of poverty. Karaffa, bishop of
Płock, on his death in 1615, left his brother 7,000,000 thalers.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
These legacies bespeak the handsome incomes of the
Polish high church dignitaries.</p>

<p>Although some of the largest ecclesiastical estates were
frequently situated along the borders of the country, and were
sometimes in a somewhat primitive condition,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> yet as a rule
the lands of the church were most favorably located, and were
compact and very productive.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> They were usually grouped
around the episcopal sees or monastic institutions in the most
productive, most thickly settled, and most easily accessible
parts of the country. A large portion of the landed property
of the bishop of Poznań was located in the county of Poznań,
in close proximity to the episcopal see and to the city. In
the county of Gniezno, the lands of the archbishop of Gniezno
constituted 22 per cent. of its area cultivated by peasants.
In the Palatinate of Łęczyce, the most thickly settled and
the most productive, the ecclesiastical lands made up also 22
per cent. of the total under peasant cultivation. In Mazovia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
in the Palatinate of Płock 71 villages belonged to the bishop
of Płock. In Red Russia in the most thickly settled and
most productive district around Lwów the church lands
constituted 5 per cent. of the area cultivated by peasants.
And when we come to Little Poland, we find that half
of the ecclesiastical lands of that province,—388 villages,
49 sections, and 9 towns, or between 440 to 450 landed
estates,—were located in the Palatinate of Cracow. The
counties containing most of them were Proszowice, Szczyrzyce,
and Ksiąsk, Proszowice leading with 183 ecclesiastical estates.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
The number of “łanów kmiecych” per square mile
shows that these counties were the best cultivated, most
productive, and the richest. The County of Proszowice numbered
62.7 “łanów kmiecych” to the square mile, the County
of Ksiąsk 40.1, and that of Szczyrzyce 32.4. In the Palatinate
of Sandomir the County of Wiślice, where again numerous
ecclesiastical estates were found, numbered 41 “łanów
kmiecych” to the square mile.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Another interesting characteristic of these ecclesiastical
lands was that they invariably bordered on royal property.
This close proximity of ecclesiastical estates to royal was to
be found everywhere in Poland in the sixteenth century.
This fact showed clearly that the ecclesiastical estates owed
their existence to royal grants; that they had been carved
out of the royal domain, and of the best portions of it.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
For wherever the ecclesiastical estates were large and numerous,
there existed also a corresponding diminution of royal
property. In Great Poland, Mazovia, and in Little Poland
the ecclesiastical property was twice as large as the royal.
In the Palatinate of Łęczyce, where the church owned 22
per cent. of the land cultivated by peasants, the king owned
only 9 per cent. In the Palatinate of Płock, where the bishop
of Płock owned 71 villages, the king had only 12 villages.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
In the Palatinate of Cracow the church owned 440-450
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
landed estates, while the king owned only about 240 to 250
estates in that rich and easily accessible section.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>In the light of these facts it is not to be wondered at that
the royal treasury found itself in the sixteenth century constantly
embarrassed; that the szlachta demanded <span lang="pl">“egzekucji
praw,”</span> that is, the return of royal property illegally acquired;
and that it was exceedingly jealous of the privileged
position of the clergy and envious of its wealth.</p>

<p>In this connection it is well to note that a similar proximity
to royal lands characterized also the large estates of
the secular aristocracy. In fact, the three groups of lands
went invariably together. The natural inference, therefore,
is that the estates of the secular aristocracy, as the estates
of the clergy, were carved out of the royal domain. That
this was actually the case there seems to be no doubt. This
further explains the jealousy of the secular aristocracy of
the clergy. It was a question of which class would be more
successful in courting the favor of the king, and as a result
of it could secure additional grants of royal land. And since
the estates of the church already were disproportionately
large, the magnates naturally kept a jealously watchful eye
on the clergy.</p>

<p>Striking as is the foregoing picture, it is necessary, in
order to make it still more realistic, to supplement it with a
number of details. It is necessary to bear in mind that the
statistics here cited, giving the landed wealth of the Polish
church in the sixteenth century, are minimum statistics; that
while they are the best we have of the period, they are not
always complete for every province; and that they do not
include the private properties cultivated by serf labor. These
statistics are based on Income Registers of the Commonwealth
Treasury. They invariably give only minimum property figures,
and only for properties from which contributions were
actually collected, omitting those that succeeded in evading
the payment of these contributions.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Then, too, they are
not always complete. For instance, the extent of the church’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
landed property in Great Poland is calculated on the basis of
statistics for only six out of the eight palatinates.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> For the
Palatinates of Sieradz and Wieluń there are no figures. Yet
we know that they, too, included church lands; for the Prebendary
of Płock was prince of Wieluń. Nor do our statistics
include the principality of Warmia. We know, also, that
the bishop of Warmia was prince of that principality. Due
to the same fact, the real extent of church lands in the eastern
provinces is likewise somewhat uncertain. Moreover, as has
already been stated, the foregoing statistics do not include
private lands cultivated by serf labor; for gentlemen paid no
land tax from the “łany” which they exploited directly by
means of forced labor. They give only estates cultivated by
tenant peasants. The tax known as “łanowe” or “poradlne”
was paid by peasants only. The private estates of the clergy
and of the nobility, cultivated by serf labor, were free from
this tax,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and consequently not listed in the tax registers.
In the fourteenth and the first half of the fifteenth century
the “łany” of the peasants were a great deal more extensive
than the demesne estates of the nobility, clerical and lay. In
the sixteenth century the peasant lands and the demesne estates
were about equal in area. By the seventeenth century the
ratio was inverted, greatly to the peasants’ disadvantage.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
In no way, then, is our picture of the extent of the Polish
church’s landed property in sixteenth century Poland overdrawn.
On the contrary, it need be supplemented in a number
of details. Its lines can safely be still more sharply and
clearly drawn, making the picture still more striking. It is
estimated that in France the landed property of the church
constituted from one-fifth to one-fourth of the lands of the
country;<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> in Poland, according to Dr. Kubala, the lands of
the church constituted one-third of the entire landed property
of the commonwealth in the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> As late as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
1791, after a considerable portion of ecclesiastical lands had
already been sold in 1790, particularly in Galicia, the peasants
of ecclesiastical lands still constituted 10.5 per cent. of the
entire population of the country at that time, or one-sixth
of the peasantry alone.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> At that time, besides their lands,
the clergy owned also over one-tenth of the houses in Poland,
or 153,551 out of a total number of 1,434,919.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, in addition to these large estates and the income
derived from them, the Polish clergy were entitled to one-tenth
of the gross receipts which the nobility derived from
their estates, to one-tenth from the peasantry, jura stolae,
free gifts of the pious, and, as a specially privileged class, to
exemption from practically all public burdens, although the
Greek Orthodox clergy were placed on the same footing with
the peasants as regards taxation.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The tithes paid to the
clergy by the nobility were voluntary at first, but by the
middle of the fifteenth century they were made compulsory;<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
and in consequence became very obnoxious to the nobility,
for they were the only tax the nobility paid.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Before the
thirteenth century the prince called upon the population of
ecclesiastical estates as well as on that of the estates of the
knighthood to participate in the building of new or in the
rebuilding of old strongholds, but in the course of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, owing to the immunities
granted the clergy, the princely right to summon the population
of ecclesiastical estates to perform any work on defenses
was either very much curtailed or altogether abolished.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
Also, the mayors of ecclesiastical villages were largely exempt
from participation in the country’s defense prior to
the reign of Casimir the Great (1333-1370). In Casimir’s
time a law was passed, making these mayors liable to military
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
service.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The clergy, however, disregarded and evaded
the provisions of this law after Casimir’s death. It was
not until in the second half of the sixteenth century that
the nobility brought the clergy to terms in this regard.
Taking their actual receipts plus the value of their exemptions
into account, Dr. Kubala estimates that the Polish
clergy of the sixteenth century were recipients of one-half
of the national income.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>It was this enormous wealth of the Polish church and its
clergy, actual and potential, that made the Polish nobility
very restless, and gradually led it as a class to an open revolt
from the Roman Catholic Church and to a determined opposition
to the Roman clergy, its pretensions, its greed, and its
exactions. This all the more so, since owing to its great
wealth, the Polish clergy had lost its religion and its moral
authority. It was far more concerned about its social position,
its political influence, and its tithes than about religion
and morals. Monastic discipline was loose. The ignorance
of the lower clergy was proverbial. Simony was the order
of the day, paving the way to higher ecclesiastical appointments.
The higher clergy were wholly indifferent to religion,
and cared far more for comfort, luxury, and the enjoyment
of life than for the things of the spirit. Bishop Zebrzydowski
of Cracow used to say: “Believe in a goat, if you wish, only
pay me your tithes.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> John Drohojowski, learned, prominent,
and influential, for years bishop of Kuyavia, preached
only twice in his church during that time.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Indifferent as the Polish clergy were in matters of religion
and morals, they were never found napping in matters of
property and the exaction of tithes. It was this greed, this
completely materialistic character of the Polish clergy, together
with their immense wealth resulting in great influence
and unscrupulous power, that chiefly paved the way in Poland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
for Hussitism in the fifteenth century and for the Reformation
in the sixteenth century. As early as 1406 and 1407
the Polish nobility in conventions at Piotrków assembled deliberated
regarding measures to safeguard itself against the
exploitation of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> In 1432, owing to a war with
the Teutonic Knights and the need of large sums of money,
regular taxation of the clergy was being considered.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> In
the course of the first half of the fifteenth century, due very
likely to the unprecedented grants of Wladislaus Jagiello to
the church, the nobility proposed a confiscation of ecclesiastical
estates.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> This proposal, as we shall see later, was repeated
again several times in the sixteenth century. At that
time the nobility protested also against the concentration of
prebendaries and benefices in the hands of a few specially
favored and privileged ecclesiastics, and against the exportation
of annates to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> These protests, too, were renewed
in the sixteenth century. In 1544 the Diet voted that the
king take steps to secure the Pope’s consent to the retention
of the papal tax within the country for purposes of defense.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
The desired papal consent had evidently not been given, for
the Diet of 1567 voted the retention of the annates, with
the king’s consent, even though against the wishes of the
Pope.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> These annates amounted to 21,266 florins annually,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
and were to strengthen the national treasury (<span lang="pl">Skarb rawski</span>).
But according to the treasury registers these annates were
not being paid in. In every annual summary report of the
Treasury a note is found, stating that the higher clergy, from
whom these annates were due, had not paid them in, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
the exception of Krasiński, bishop of Cracow, and his successor,
Peter Myszkowski.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> So stubborn were the bishops that
the Diet of 1569 threatened them with collecting double the
amount from all the delinquent payers, and the Diet of 1576
had to call upon them again to comply with the law regarding
annates.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>By a law of 1496 and 1505 the nobility, with its eye on
the wealth of the church, restricted all the higher ecclesiastical
offices and preferments to itself and its sons, excluding
from them the townspeople and all plebeians.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In 1510 and
again in 1527, as the needs of the country were steadily
growing, it was proposed that the clergy share in carrying
the burdens of the country’s defense along with the nobility.
In all proposed measures of treasury reform in the sixteenth
century the clergy were singled out as the wealthiest estate
in the land and placed at the head of the lists of those best
able to help bear public burdens. In some of the proposals
they were asked to give up their tithes to the needs of the
country, and bishops and abbots were urged to contribute the
annates to the national treasury.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The clergy, however, protested
vigorously. They were opposed to any taxation of
their property; at the same time they were also reluctant to
make voluntary contributions.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The collection of the “subsidium
charitativum” was always a very difficult matter.
Out of the 40,000 florins, which the clergy agreed in 1510 to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
contribute toward the country’s needs, only 7,000 florins actually
came into the national treasury.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> At the synod of
1577 the clergy manifested the greatest reluctance to make
any contribution,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and the same thing was true in every
case until the end of Poland’s national existence toward the
close of the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Yet in justice to the clergy
it must be said that once in a while they did manifest unusual
liberality. Inspired by the new religious reform movement
of the century, the nobility went so far in 1536 and 1537 as
to propose confiscation and a sale of all ecclesiastical estates,
which were tax-free, and on account of which the nobility
had to bear all the heavier public burdens.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> In 1563 it at
last succeeded in securing actual taxation of ecclesiastical
property.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> In 1576 it again protested against the great
wealth of the church.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> And so practically throughout the
sixteenth century it struggled under the inspiration and with
the help of the religious reform movement against the social
and economic oppression and exactions of the Roman clergy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Conflict Between the Polish Nobility and the
Clergy: its Economic Aspects</span></h4>
</div>


<p class="p2">Besides the great wealth of the church as such, there existed
a whole series of potent causes, all essentially economic
in their nature, leading to a revolt from the established
church and furthering the spread of religious reform.</p>

<p>The social classes in Poland affected by the Reformation
were the townspeople and the szlachta or nobility. Of the two
the most influential class as well as the most instrumental
in the promotion of the religious reform movement was the
nobility. The townspeople were unfortunately largely of German
nationality, foreigners in a foreign land, and consequently
without either social or political influence. The nobility,
however, was both Polish and politically powerful. In
the sixteenth century it constituted not only the Polish nation
but also the Polish state. Hence, as in Germany the Reformation
owed its firm foothold to the protection of the
German princes, so in Poland it owed its spread to the protection
of the Polish nobility, particularly the magnates.</p>

<p>The political foundation underlying the szlachta’s favorable
attitude toward the Reformation, its open revolt from
the established church, its bitter and determined conflict with
the Roman hierarchy, and its enthusiastic support of the new
religious movement consisted of a number of special fundamental
rights and privileges guaranteed it by various royal
charters. The first important charter was the Pact of Koszyce
of 1374. By this pact, in exchange for its consent to extend
the right of succession to the Polish throne to the daughters
of Louis of Hungary, including even the youngest, Jadwiga,
the Polish nobility as a class was guaranteed exemption from
all public burdens except a nominal tax of two <span lang="pl">“grosze”</span> per
<span lang="pl">“łan kmiecy,”</span> which in reality was paid by the peasantry
rather than by the nobility, freedom from royal levies of
special or extraordinary taxes, compensation for military services
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
outside the country and damages for injuries or losses
sustained in the course of such foreign campaigns.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Moreover,
royal appointments to high public offices of state in any
part of the country were restricted by this pact to the native
nobility therein resident to the exclusion of possible foreign
favorites of the crown.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Thus, by this pact the szlachta obtained
a very important economic advantage, and secured
itself as a class against arbitrary fiscal oppression or political
discrimination by the king.</p>

<p>In 1422, forced by fiscal and judicial abuses and economic
oppression, particularly by the forcible measures employed by
the clergy in their collection of tithes from heretical and
recalcitrant Hussite members of the nobility,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> the szlachta
took advantage of a war exigency, and in the camp at Czerwińsk,
Mazovia, on the eve of a military expedition against
the Teutonic Knights, exacted another charter from the king,
Wladislaus Jagiello, known as the Privilege of Czerwińsk.
By this charter, among other things, the Polish nobility was
guaranteed inviolability of its hereditary property rights
against any arbitrary action either of the king or any of his
official representatives. The king promised the nobility not
to seize or to confiscate, nor to allow any of his officials to
seize or to confiscate the hereditary property of any one of
his subjects, whatever his rank or condition, without due process
of law.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> This royal guaranty henceforth precluded any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
unfair oppressive exactions from the szlachta under threat
of confiscation of property or any arbitrary interference with
the property rights of any szlachcic on the part of either the
king or his officials. That the exaction of this guaranty was
a foresighted master stroke on the part of the Polish nobility
is proved by the Edict of Wieluń, issued only two years later,
which decreed the confiscation of property of heretics.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Had
it not been for the Privilege of Czerwieńsk, the Polish nobility
would have been left wholly at the mercy of the clergy.</p>

<p>A few years later Wladislaus Jagiello, desirous to secure
the Polish throne for his sons, born of his fourth marriage,
sought to obtain their recognition as his successors by the
Polish estates. The Polish nobility acceded to the wish of
the king, but in consideration of this concession sought and
obtained at Jedlnia in 1430 the famous charter generally
known as the <span lang="la">“Neminem captivabimus, nisi jure victum”</span>
privilege. This charter constituted the Polish “habeas corpus”
act. According to its terms no nobleman could be
arrested except upon the verdict of a court or when actually
caught in the act of committing arson, murder, rape, or
village plunder.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> By its provisions the personal liberties of
the Polish nobility were both enlarged and more securely
guarded. The two privileges, that of Czerwieńsk and that of
Jedlnia, were of great importance and value to the Polish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
nobility; the former guaranteed the inviolability of its property,
the latter of its persons.</p>

<p>The other two very important charters obtained by the
Polish nobility were the Statutes of Nieszawa of 1454 and
the <span lang="la">“Nihil Novi”</span> Constitution framed by the Diet of Radom
in 1505. The distinguishing features of these two documents
were matters of jurisdiction and legislation. By the
first the szlachta freed itself from the jurisdiction of royal
administrative officials. From now on it was subject to the
jurisdiction of the starostas, the royal administrative and
judicial officials, only in four kinds of cases, arson, murder,
rape, and theft. In other cases it was subject to the jurisdiction
of provincial courts, for which, according to the
Statutes of Nieszawa, it secured the privilege to nominate
in the event of vacancies four candidates for judge, assistant
judge, and court clerk. From these nominees of the provincial
szlachta the king selected one for the respective vacancy.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
In this way by its control of the provincial judiciary
the szlachta assured for itself a fairer administration of justice.
By the second it freed itself from arbitrary legislation.
According to the Constitution of Radom the king was not
permitted to make any new laws without the common consent
of the senate and the representatives of the szlachta.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
By this constitutional provision the rank and file of the nobility
represented in the Chamber of Deputies came now into
full control of legislation, and became masters of their own
destinies.</p>

<p>By these charters the Polish nobility was guaranteed the
most important fundamental rights and liberties of free citizens,
freedom from taxation without its consent, security of
person and of property, fair administration of justice, and
immunity from arbitrary royal decrees jeopardizing its fundamental
rights. Protected by these guaranties the Polish nobility
was free to assume and to maintain any attitude it
pleased toward the Reformation movement. It could with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
reasonable degree of safety defy the king and Pope alike.
This is what helps us to understand the spread of the Reformation
in Poland in the face of numerous royal edicts
against heresy and heretics, with their extremely severe penalties
of exile, confiscation of property, infamy, and even
death.</p>

<p>The economic basis of the ecclesiastical revolt of the Polish
nobility, and a most powerful motive therefor, was created
by the commercial and industrial transformation of Poland
in the sixteenth century. The chief causes leading thereto
were three significant historical events, all happening during
the second half of the fifteenth century; namely, the conquest
of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, the discovery
of America by Columbus in 1492, and Poland’s final complete
triumph over the Order of the Teutonic Knights, sealed by
the Peace of Thorn in 1466. The first closed the old paths
of commerce with the Levant and the Orient; the second
opened up new trade routes and new markets to the West;
the third added West Prussia with the city of Danzig to
Poland, and gave that country control of the lower course
of the Vistula River and free access to the sea.</p>

<p>Owing to the first two historical events, the commercial
centre of Europe shifted from the coasts of the Mediterranean
to the coasts of the Atlantic and the Baltic, and the countries
lying along these coasts profited by this change.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The
cities of Antwerp, Bruges, Amsterdam, and Danzig became
great emporia of Northwestern Europe. Toward the close
of the fifteenth and during the sixteenth centuries the commerce
of the Baltic turned out to be the hub of European
commerce with the port of Danzig as its centre. From 1466
on the commerce of that city grew steadily. In 1428 the
number of ships that arrived in Danzig was 110. In the
years 1422, 1429, 1430, and 1432 flotillas of 70, 61, 40, and
59 ships laden with corn sailed from its port. In 1474, 1475,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and 1476 the ships arriving in Danzig numbered 403, 525,
and 634 respectively. Again, in 1490, 1491, and 1492 the
number of ships sailing from Danzig was 720, 607, and 562
for the respective years.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The main articles of its import were cloth from the Netherlands,
England, and Scotland; linen from Scotland; salt
from France, Germany, England, and the Netherlands; horses
from southern Sweden, Finland, and the islands of Oeland,
Gottland, and Bornholm; iron from Sweden; and wines, beer,
and hops, fish, and southern fruits and vegetables from the
South of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The principal articles of its export were
agricultural and forest products, wheat, rye, barley, leguminous
vegetables, lumber, ashes, pitch, and tar. The chief
producer of its exports as well as the chief consumer of its
imports was Poland.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Toward the close of the fifteenth and
throughout the sixteenth century that country was the granary
of Southern and Western Europe. Its grain was in great
demand in cities of Italy, Portugal, and Spain as well as
in the markets of Holland, Scandinavia, France, and Scotland.
In 1527 the Senate of Venice voted a premium on
grain imported from Poland, and later in the second half
of the sixteenth century a number of Italian rulers and the
Pope himself addressed urgent requests to the city of Danzig
for grain shipments.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Its lumber and forest products were
used by Holland, England, and Scotland for ship-building
purposes.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The annexation of West Prussia with the city of Danzig
by the Treaty of Thorn, was, therefore, a very significant and
happy event as regards the commercial and economic development
of Poland. The place she had lost in the commerce
of the East as a result of the fall of Constantinople into the
hands of the Turks she now regained on the Baltic. This
event enabled her to participate in the new world commerce
by opening up to her a new unobstructed way to new and
greater world markets. The change wrought was not only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
in the direction, but also in the nature and the volume of her
commerce. The old eastern commerce was mainly transit
commerce; its principal beneficiaries were the townspeople
of the Polish cities. The new commerce assumed the form
of export and import commerce; and its chief beneficiaries
turned out to be the Polish nobles as the producers of export
commodities.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>This change in commercial routes and in the nature and
volume of the new commerce exerted a profound influence
on Poland’s economic and social conditions. The great demand
for grain in Western Europe and Poland’s new and
easy access to world markets led to a revival of Polish agriculture,
resulting in a more intensive cultivation of the soil,
increasing exports of agricultural products, growing prosperity,
and in new deepening interest on the part of the
Polish nobility in agriculture rather than in war. Thus,
while Western Europe was rapidly passing from an agricultural
to an industrial stage of economic development, Poland
after the middle of the fifteenth century became transformed
into an intensely agricultural country, growing and exporting
grain by way of the Vistula and the Baltic to meet the demand
of western markets.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>To facilitate the new commerce all hitherto existing trade
restrictions and barriers were removed, tolls on products
transported either by water or by land were abolished, and
commerce was given free movement. By a statute of Casimir
Jagiello of the year 1447 the principal navigable rivers of
Poland were opened to unobstructed water transportation, the
public good and abundance of necessary commodities being
now regarded as more important than fishing rights. At the
same time all internal tolls were annulled and abolished and
their collection prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> The new regulations with their
penalties for their transgressors were renewed and reaffirmed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
in the reign of John Albert in 1496.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> And since there were
some who disregarded these statutory provisions, as for instance
the burghers of Thorn, John Albert promised to exercise
special vigilance in their enforcement in order that water
transportation to Danzig might be free and safe.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Nevertheless,
in spite of these laws, there still were complaints in
the Diet of 1538 against the collection of transport tolls by
private individuals. In consequence of these all privileges
granted private individuals and towns to levy and collect road
and bridge tolls, with the exception of such as were necessary
for the convenience of the travelling public, were abrogated
altogether.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Due to the removal of all commercial barriers
and obstructions and a good and convenient channel of export,
such as the Vistula was, Poland’s commerce grew by leaps
and bounds, bringing unprecedented prosperity to the country.</p>

<p>To meet somewhat adequately the demands of trade and
at the same time to take advantage of the unusual opportunities
for gain and enrichment, the Polish landowners
turned to agriculture in dead earnest. This caused a change
in the method of agriculture and created a great demand for
more land and for more labor. Intensive agriculture and large
scale production of agricultural products became the rule of
the day. From the middle of the fifteenth century on through
the sixteenth century the demesne estates of the Polish nobles
and of the clergy were in process of enlargement by various
methods. Waste and fallow lands were brought under cultivation,
swamps were drained and made productive, and forests
were cleared and the clearings were converted into fertile
farms.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Expropriation of village mayorships was another
method by which the demesne estates were being enlarged.
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Polish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
princes, and following their example, the magnates and the
clergy, in order to encourage colonization, offered special inducements
to German colonizing entrepreneurs by allowing
them for their services a certain amount of land free of
charge and of all public burdens, and by granting them
special rights and privileges, which placed them practically
on an equal footing with the Polish nobility. These mayorships
with their rights and privileges were hereditary. By
a statute of 1423, however, the Polish landlords were given
the right to buy out these village mayorships from their
owners.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The steps necessary to be taken were to summon
such a village mayor before a “judicium terrestre,” and to
notify him of the intention of the lord of the manor to expropriate
him. To be sure, the statute declared that this
procedure was to be applied only against useless or rebellious
mayors; but there was nothing easier to prove than the rebelliousness
of a village mayor whom the lord of the manor
wanted to expropriate. This method of enlarging the demesne
estates was profitable to the lords in more ways than
one. It transferred to the seigniorial reserve and its lord
not only the land of the expropriated village mayor or mayors,
but also the labor, the feudal dues, and all the rights and
privileges which the village mayor or mayors formerly enjoyed.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
This practice lasted from the middle of the fifteenth
to the middle of the sixteenth century, and was resorted to
by the Polish clergy as well as by the Polish nobility.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Still another method of increasing the demesne estates of
the lords was by incorporating into the demesne estate temporarily
vacant peasant leaseholds. This practice became very
common after the middle of the fifteenth century. Owing to
the depreciation of money values and the rise of prices, especially
for agricultural products, lands leased to peasants
at a certain fixed money rental were not very profitable. The
lands of the manorial estate cultivated by the lord directly
by forced labor were yielding far more alluring returns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Hence, it came about that whenever a peasant left his lot,
the lord of the manor, instead of settling it by leasing it out
to another peasant family, simply annexed it to his seigniorial
reserve and cultivated it by forced labor. This practice
proved so profitable that the lords began gradually to resort
to all sorts of oppressive methods for the purpose of driving
the tenant peasants away from their leaseholds, so that they
could then declare the deserted leaseholds as vacant, and
annex them to their demesne estates. There were also instances
of unceremonious transfers of peasant families to
the manors and of straightforward seizures of their leaseholds.
This was frequently done in case a peasant’s house
burned down. Instead of rebuilding it, the lord preferred to
show his hospitality by transfering the peasant’s family to
the manor, where they became his servants.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The incorporation
of deserted peasant lots into the lord’s private domain
was especially tempting inasmuch as such “deserted” or
“vacant” peasant lots were free from the “poradlne” or
“łanowe,” a tax of two “grosze” paid by the nobility into
the royal treasury.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>Land ownership was looked upon as a special privilege of
the Polish nobility. The szlachta, therefore, strove with determination
toward its complete monopolization and toward
the monopolization of agricultural production.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Its next
step was to exclude the townspeople from land ownership,
to prohibit the clergy further to enlarge their landed estates,
and to restrict access to all the higher ecclesiastical offices
with their rich benefices to itself and its sons. To that end
it employed legislative means. By the Constitution of 1496
the Polish nobility excluded the townspeople together with
the peasantry from owning any landed estates and from access
to any high offices in the church. According to the provisions
of that document people of plebeian rank could neither buy
new landed estates, nor continue to hold those they were
already in possession of. They were called upon to dispose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
of their lands as speedily as convenient under penalty of
being deprived of them.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> In like manner they were excluded
also from the higher appointments in the church. Lured
by the wealth connected with these appointments, the Polish
nobility by law restricted eligibility to them to its own
class.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The restrictions regarding ecclesiastical appointments
were reaffirmed by the Constitution of 1505, and violations
of them were to be punished by perpetual exile and
confiscation of property.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> These restrictions, however, were
frequently disregarded and violated. Foreigners and plebeians
in favor at the papal court succeeded in getting cathedral
appointments and appointments to other high church offices
and lucrative benefices. Against these flagrant violations of
the law the szlachta rose in protest at the Diet of 1532, demanding
enforcement of the statutes of 1496 and 1505 and
punishment not only of those who contrary to law secured
higher ecclesiastical appointments, but also of those who
helped them to get these appointments.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But these protests
and the new constitutional provisions seemed to remain without
effect, for in 1533 the szlachta of Great Poland presented
the king with a memorial, protesting again against appointments
of foreigners and plebeians to cathedral churches. The
king in order to pacify the szlachta, issued a new decree,
reemphasizing the fact that foreigners and plebeians were
excluded from all higher ecclesiastical benefices under penalty
of banishment and confiscation of property.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> However, it
seems that the king himself did not conform to law; for
in 1534 the szlachta presented a petition to him, requesting
him to have regard for his own subjects, their laws and customs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
to treat them with greater consideration than foreigners
and plebeians, and not to appoint the latter to any high ecclesiastical
offices or as his secretaries.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The continued disregard
and violations of these constitutional restrictions
angered the szlachta, and stirred it up to a growing and more
determined opposition not only to the clergy, but also to
Rome and the Roman Church at large, driving it more and
more into the enemy’s camp, the Reformation. To add fuel
to the fire, the king, pressed by the Roman clergy,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> issued
February 4, 1535, a severe edict against heretical doctrines
and books, the attendance of the Polish youth at Wittenberg
or any other place infected with heresy, and ordered any
such students to return home under penalty of deprivation of
all honors and of perpetual exile.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The result was that at
the following Diet, held the same year, the szlachta directed
a strong attack upon the class privileges of the clergy, and
actually succeeded in having the Diet pass three measures
relative to the problem of “the execution of laws,” which
threatened the very foundation of the church’s rights and
privileges. These measures called upon all churches and
monastic institutions to present at the next Diet their charters
for examination, the purpose being to annul all such rights
and privileges of the church as were contrary to the principles
of public law and welfare.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> The sessions of the Diet
were very stormy, and the property of the clergy, together
with their privileges, was the object of contention. In 1533,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Bishop Chojeński wrote to Archbishop Krzycki, primate of
Poland, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I exceedingly regret the way the Diet dissolved, especially when I
reflect and see where it all tends and to what consequences such
beginnings are apt to lead. Would that it might not result in
destruction of our clerical estate! For we see now the most arrogant
and audacious people, to whose insatiable passions there is
nothing sacred or inviolable, who draw inspiration and power from
their wilfulness and impunity, lie in wait for the church’s property.
It is the duty of your Reverence, who are the head and primate of
our clerical estate in these parts of ours, to watch diligently that
their impious purposes may not be realized in our times at least.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When it became evident that the king did not intend to
carry out the wishes of the Diet of 1535, the szlachta of
Great Poland instructed its deputies to the Diet of 1536-1537
to insist on “the execution of laws,” which included
the matter of the church’s privileges. At this Diet the Chamber
of Deputies raised, therefore, most violent protests against
the abuses described, and vigorously demanded conformity to
law and restoration of all illegally acquired benefices and
church property. At the same time the Chamber demanded
that henceforth the king appoint to abbacies and other lucrative
church benefices only native Poles of noble birth, or
plebeians of Polish nationality in the event that there are
not enough candidates of noble birth to fill vacancies. The
leaders in this movement were Raphael Leszczyński, Stanislaus
Myszkowski, Nicholas Krzycki, and John Sierakowski,
who later on became well-known champions of the Reformation
movement.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Moreover, in 1538 the Diet passed a law,
according to which anyone receiving anything contrary to
statutory enactments by courting the favor of the Vatican
was thereby ipso facto proscribed and his possessions were
confiscated. By the same law all church dignitaries residing
in Rome away from their appointments were recalled, and if
they failed to return to the country within a specified time,
they were to be deprived of their offices and banished, and
were not to be permitted to enter the country.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
But high ecclesiastical offices richly endowed were after all
limited in number. If the Polish nobility was to find larger
access to the landed property of the church, it had to get to
it in other ways, which it did. If the secular nobles were
keen in buying up village mayorships, so were the Polish
clergy. In fact, they were in possession of more mayorships
than the secular nobles.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Then, too, their landed estates
were further augmented by bequests of pious persons. These
things were a thorn in the flesh to the Polish nobility. It
sought ways and means of preventing this constant increase
of church property. As early as 1510 testamentary bequests
of real estate property to the church were prohibited by
statutory enactment.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> In 1534 the szlachta at its provincial
diets unanimously demanded that the General Diet restrain
the clergy from buying up village mayorships, with the result
that in the end a law was enacted prohibiting all transfers
of estates with nobility rights and privileges to the clergy
whether by gift, sale, or any other method.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The stormy
Diet of 1536-1537 went still further, demanding the secularization
of all ecclesiastical estates and the sale to the
szlachta of all the newly acquired lands of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Nor did
the nobles stop at mere demands and legislative enactments;
occasionally they took matters directly into their hands. For
instance, whenever and wherever there was an opportunity
to seize the land of a parish priest or a prebendary, the nobles
were quite ready to take advantage of it. In the sixteenth
century, influenced and encouraged by the Reformation movement,
the Polish nobles did not hesitate to resort to that
method of dealing with ecclesiastical property, and of thus
enlarging their own demesne estates.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the revival of agriculture created a demand not
only for more land, but also for more labor, and cheap labor.
We have already noted that farming by tenant peasants was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
not any more profitable to the landlords in the sixteenth century,
and that there was a strong tendency to annex the peasant
leaseholds to the demesne estates. But as the demesne
estates increased in size the labor problem grew more acute
every day. To solve it, the noble landlords began to change
the status of the peasants by legislation. Thus former free
peasants became gradually, as a result of a series of legislative
enactments, glebae adscripti. They were not any longer
free to leave their masters at will; and if they did, their
masters had the right to demand their return, or to pursue
them and bring them back.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Of a family of peasant children,
only one might leave the estate on which he was born, and go
to the city into service, or for the purpose of study or of
learning a trade.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> An only child was forbidden to leave the
land; he had to pass into the serfdom of his parents.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> And
if a peasant youth escaped, he was to be restored to his master
under penalty of forty marks.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Not only were the Polish
peasants bound to the soil in the sixteenth century, they were
now also compelled to do forced labor on their masters’ estates.
In 1477 the provincial diet of <span lang="pl">“Ziemia chełmska”</span>
established one day a week of forced peasant labor on the
estate of the lord. In 1520 the General Diets of Thorn and
Bydgoszcz extended this local provision to the peasants on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
all the manors in the country.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Thus what had hitherto
been a matter of private arrangement was now made a statutory
and universal obligation. And gradually as time went
on the number of forced labor was increased to two days a
week and more.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Worst of all, under the influence of Roman
law, which recognized only masters and slaves, the Polish
peasants lost also their standing before the law, and were
subjected wholly to the jurisdiction of their lords.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> This
removed the last vestige of the peasants’ personal rights, and
made them practically the property of the aristocratic landlords.</p>

<p>Besides monopolizing agricultural production, the Polish
nobles obtained exemption from export and import duties
on all products raised on their own estates for export and on
all goods imported for their own use and not for trade.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
By this stroke they secured a monopoly advantage in trade
also, and became the chief beneficiaries of all its benefits to
the detriment and destruction of the Polish town population.</p>

<p>The changes in Poland’s commerce and agriculture in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had a very important bearing
on the country’s problems of defense and finance. They
disqualified the Polish nobility for warfare, and they undermined
the revenues of the state. The szlachta, settled on
the land, grew more attached to the soil and to the life of
country gentlemen than to the camp and the discomforts of
military service. Stimulated by the new commercial opportunities
and the prospect for gain and enrichment, it naturally
became more interested in agriculture and in exports
of its agricultural products than in warfare and military
expeditions. The rewards of agriculture and of commerce
were greater, more certain, less hazardous, and consequently
more alluring than those of war. Moreover, the changes in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
warfare, resulting from the invention of gunpowder, demanded
the employment of new methods in the conduct of
war, called for more costly equipment, which the warriors
had to provide themselves at their own expense, and were
fraught with greater perils to life. Naturally, therefore, the
nobility grew reluctant to leave the soil, and to engage in
war; and when actually called out in emergency in <span lang="pl">“pospolite
ruszenie”</span> it was far more interested in political than in military
maneuvers, in extracting new privileges from the king
than in vanquishing the enemy. Whether as a defensive or
as an offensive force the <span lang="pl">“pospolite ruszenie”</span> became now
both physically inadequate and temperamentally unfit for
war. Yet the country’s wars with the Teutonic Knights,
Russia, Moldavia, Courland, and the city of Danzig, and its
constant menace of Tartar invasion called for a strong and
ever-ready military force to repel aggression, subdue rebellion,
and to protect the borders in order to guard the country’s
safety and to maintain its integrity and prestige.</p>

<p>These conditions created the necessity of hiring mercenaries.
But mercenaries had to be paid. This called for more
state funds, which, however, were very hard to raise. The
old revenues, which even under ordinary conditions would
have been inadequate for the new needs, were rendered all
the more inadequate by the fact that their sources instead
of being increased were actually diminished. This was due
to a number of causes. The lavish generosity of the Polish
kings, particularly the Jagiellos, greatly reduced the royal
domain and the royal income therefrom. Exemption of the
nobility by the Pact of Koszyce (1374) from all taxation
except two grosze per łan kmiecy and by the Constitution of
1496 from all export and import duties, and of the clergy
from all public burdens and responsibilities, contributed to
the depletion of the royal treasury and to the weakening of
the country’s defense. This evil was still further accentuated
by the processes of annexing “vacant” peasant leaseholds to
the demesne estates and of buying up of village mayorships by
the clergy. The first withdrew the annexed peasant lands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
from taxation;<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> the second rendered the mayorships free
from participation in the country’s defense. Out of a total
number of 14,000 village mayorships, which had in the past
participated in the “pospolite ruszenie,” only 2,000 still answered
the call to arms by 1539, according to a complaint of
the deputies at the Diet of Cracow of that year.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> These
things combined to impoverish the royal treasury, to put the
king in constant financial straits, and to jeopardize the peace
and security of the country.</p>

<p>To eliminate these difficulties and to provide adequate defense
for the country, special contributions or taxes had to
be voted from time to time. The demand for these special
contributions grew greater and more frequent as time went
on. With every year the nobility felt the burden of defense
more keenly. It looked around for help and for new sources
of revenue. These were by no means hard to find. The
wealth and resources of the clergy presented an excellent
source of defensive strength. The szlachta began, therefore,
to demand the participation of the clergy in the responsibilities
and burdens of public life and of the country’s defense.
This resulted in a sharp conflict between the clergy and the
Polish nobility, a conflict which lasted for two centuries and
which found expression in the fifteenth century in the Hussite
movement and in the sixteenth in the Reformation.</p>

<p>The Polish clergy’s privileged character respecting their
participation in public responsibilities and burdens constituted
the most sensitive point of difference between the Polish
szlachta and the Polish Roman Catholic clergy.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> According
to Casimir’s Code the duty of participation in the country’s
defense rested upon all hereditary estates of the Polish knighthood,
regardless of the fact as to whether any of their owners
happened to belong at a particular time to the ranks of the
clergy or not.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Moreover, it was very early established that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
lands newly acquired by the church were subject to military
service. A statute of 1437 provided that all church lands
acquired by purchase within the last forty years and those
that might be thus acquired in the future were required to
render military service.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> But throughout the fifteenth century
the owners of these lands were clever and successful
enough in evading these provisions and in maintaining the
principle of their freedom from participation in the country’s
defense. In 1506 at the Diet of Lublin they even succeeded
in securing royal sanction of their freedom from rendering
military service due from these lands. Gradually, contrary
to the law of Casimir the Great, they extended this principle
of their exemption from military service even to their hereditary
lands and to village mayorships purchased by them.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Naturally, the Polish szlachta rose in arms. It demanded
that the mayors of ecclesiastical villages render military service
as did the mayors of secular villages; that if the clergy
objected, they should produce their privileges exempting the
mayors of their villages from that public duty; that the Diet
should prohibit the clergy from buying village mayorships;
that all newly acquired ecclesiastical lands should be sold to
the nobility, which was bearing the burden of public defense;
that the clergy be placed on the same footing with the secular
nobility in respect of participation in public defense; that
their lands be secularized and the income from them be used
for purposes of public defense; and that the clergy assume
their fair share of special taxes levied by the diets. To be
sure, all these demands were not made at once; but they
were all made with varying insistence in the course of the
first three-quarters of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>According to a statute of Casimir the Great of the year
1347 the mayors of ecclesiastical villages as well as the mayors
of secular villages were required to participate in military
expeditions.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> This obligation was reaffirmed by the Constitution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
of 1538,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> and again in 1550.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> But, as we have
already noted, the clergy succeeded in evading these statutory
provisions not only throughout the fifteenth, but also in
the sixteenth century. It is not strange, therefore, to find
that as the burden of defense was increasing in weight the
Polish nobility repeatedly demanded that the mayors of ecclesiastical
villages take part in the country’s defense in compliance
with the law. The first demand of this nature in the
sixteenth century was made as early as 1510; then we find it
repeated at the Diet of 1536-1537; and again in 1563. In
1510 the king referred the question at issue to the provincial
synod for review, and the synod was to report on it at a subsequent
general diet.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But the matter was evidently laid
aside and remained so as long as it was possible to keep it
from coming to the front again; for when it was brought up
at the Diet of 1536-1537, it was again treated in a similar
manner. The bishops agreed to comply with the law, provided
it was proved to them that the mayors of their villages
were subject to military service. Their special privileges,
which they claimed to possess, were to be examined at the
following synod, and then the matter was to be reported on
at the general diet.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Presumably the matter stopped there
as before; for at the Diet of 1558-1559 the Chamber of
Deputies raised the old question again, and demanded of the
bishops the presentation of their special privileges exempting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
the mayors of ecclesiastical villages from military service.
But even then the clergy did not produce this documentary
evidence until at the Diet of 1563; and when actually produced,
it was found wanting, owing to its indefiniteness.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>The stubborn opposition of the Polish hierarchy to share
in the burden of defense in this mild form caused the Polish
nobility to stiffen its demands. Since the Polish bishops so
strenuously objected to the participation of the mayors of
ecclesiastical villages in the pospolite ruszenie, the szlachta
came forward at the Diet of Thorn in 1520 with the demand
that the clergy as a class be put on the same level as the
secular nobility in regard to military service.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> All the clergy
in possession of landed estates were to participate in the
pospolite ruszenie along with the szlachta. This demand was
renewed and firmly insisted upon at a local diet of the
nobility of Great Poland at Kolo in 1533, at the General Diet
of 1535,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and even as late as 1562 at the Diet of Piotrków.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
This summary demand on the part of the Polish nobility that
the clergy as a landowning class share equally with the
szlachta the burden of defense startled the clergy, and finally
induced them to present their documentary privileges, on
which they based their claim of exemption from the burden
of defense at the subsequent Diet of Piotrków, which met in
the fall of 1563. On examination these documents were
found to be anything but explicit and clear; yet the nobility
had relented by this time, and ceased pressing this particular
demand any further.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Owing to this stubborn opposition on the part of the clergy
to their personal participation in military service and to that
of the bailiffs of ecclesiastical villages as well, the Polish
nobility turned its attack now directly upon the landed property
and the incomes of the clergy. In 1534 and in 1535 it
vehemently protested against the purchases of village bailiwicks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
by the clergy. In 1536-1537, at the Diet of Piotrków,
it went still further, and urgently demanded the secularization
of all ecclesiastical property. As a result of this determined
stand, a plan was actually agreed upon between the
Chamber of Deputies and the secular members of the Senate
for partial secularization of church lands. According to this
plan all ecclesiastical lands acquired by the clergy whether
by gift or by purchase since Louis the Great, 1370-1382, were
to be sold to the nobility.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> The demand for the secularization
of ecclesiastical estates was first made in the first half
of the fifteenth century, then in 1524, with increasing vigor
and insistence at the Diet of Piotrków in 1536-1537, and
again in 1576.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> How determined the Polish nobility was to
get hold of the property of the clergy may be seen from the
fact that in 1539, when the old king, Sigismund <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, was
critically ill, a conspiracy was actually formed, the purpose
of which was not to recognize Sigismund Augustus in the
event of his father’s death until he agreed to and sanctioned
the confiscation of one-third of the church lands for purposes
of national defense.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The leaders in this conspiracy, as well
as in the rebellion of 1537, were Martin and Peter Zborowski,
ardent advocates of the Reformation after 1550.</p>

<p>Nor were the incomes of the clergy to escape the Polish
nobility’s attack. Whenever the country was in financial
straits, the nobility in a general diet assembled voted special
taxes to meet special emergencies. The clergy, however, were
not liable to these special taxes voted by the diets. They
claimed exemption from them. Yet they did come forward
in each emergency with a voluntary contribution, known as
<span lang="la">“subsidium charitativum.”</span> This was based on a general
estimate of the clergy’s general income. As this estimate
usually constituted only one-third and frequently one-eighth
of the real income of the clergy, their voluntary contributions
based on such estimates were obviously far below their ability
to pay. Manifestly this was unfair and unjust to the nobility.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
It, therefore, demanded that the clergy pay a contribution
based on an evaluation of their specific sources of revenue,
such as their estates, their tithes, and other sources of income.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>To this demand of the nobility the clergy were most decidedly
opposed. At the same time they were not a little
apprehensive that it might result in consequences unfavorable
to them. To safeguard themselves, they voted a liberal contribution
of 40,000 florins in 1511 for the purpose of redemption
of certain royal lands in Red Russia; and in exchange
for this contribution they exacted from the king a solemn
pledge that henceforth they would be free from military obligations
and from all other burdens, with the exception of
the customary subsidium charitativum, based on an evaluation
of their general income, in cases of a pospolite ruszenie.
A written document confirming the pledge of 1511 was issued
to the clergy by the king, December 10, 1515.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> This furnished
the clergy a certain legal basis for their opposition to
the nobility’s demands. When, therefore, the Diets of 1525
and 1527 imposed a tax on the specific sources of the clergy’s
income, the clergy at their Synod of Łęczyce in 1527, owing
to a threatening Tartar invasion, again voted a voluntary
contribution to the country’s needs, but flatly refused to be
taxed by the diets.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>But if the clergy were stubborn in their resistence to taxation
by the diets, so were the diets in their insistence on such
taxation of clerical property. At the Diet of 1525 a revaluation
of ecclesiastical property was proposed. The bishops
opposed this course resolutely, fearing that a precedent might
be established for the diet to tax their tithes. Their fear was
not groundless. In 1529 at the Diet of Warsaw the deputies
refused to take up the business of the diet until the bishops
declared what percentage of their tithes they would give as a
contribution to the defense of the country. The bishops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
strenuously objected on the ground that the nobles did not
tax their own incomes but insisted on taxing those of the
clergy. The conflict reached a deadlock, and finally the whole
question was referred to the king. When at the subsequent
diet, called for November 11, 1530, at Piotrków, the Chamber
of Deputies moved to impose a tax on the tithes of the clergy,
its attempt encountered a determined opposition, not only on
the part of the clergy, but also on the part of the king. In
consequence of this combined clerical and royal opposition
the Chamber developed an equally solid front against the immunities
of the church, and demanded the passage of a law
taxing the clergy in proportion to the real value of all their
property. In case the clergy refused to comply, the deputies
threatened to suspend all payments of tithes, and to put the
proposed law through and in force at the very next pospolite
ruszenie of the szlachta.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this an empty threat. For more than a century
and a half, ever since the reign of Casimir the Great (1333-1370),
the Polish nobility had chafed under the burden of
church tithes. In its relation to the king it was free from all
special compulsory taxes for the benefit of the royal treasury,
save a nominal tax of two grosze per łan kmiecy, paid in
reality by the tenant peasants rather than by the landlords
themselves. But in its relation to the church it was not as
free. The burden of church tithes rested upon it. Originally
voluntary, it became compulsory in the first half of the
fifteenth century; and it was a burden that could not be
shifted. It was, also, a burden which the clergy never failed
to exact.</p>

<p>Conflicts over the payment of tithes were, therefore, frequent.
They occurred as early as the reign of Casimir the
Great,<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and as time went on they grew more bitter and more
frequent. Owing to the growth of the church in wealth and
of the clergy in arrogance as a result of Wladislaus Jagiello’s
great liberality and even subserviency, the nobility was forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
to consider measures at the Convocations of Piotrków in 1406
and 1407 for protection against this exploitation.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> By the
Privilege of Czerwieńsk forced from the king in 1422 it
further secured itself against the relentless exaction of
tithes.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> A decade later the special privileges concerning
tithes given the clergy by Wladislaus Jagiello in 1433,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and
the king’s assurance that he would assist in the collection of
this tax, are evidence of the difficulties encountered. To force
the clergy to desist from their pretensions, the nobility, under
the leadership of Andrew Zbonsz, Spytek of Melsztyn, and
John Strasz, decided at the Convocation of Piotrków, August
15, 1435, to withhold the payment of tithes altogether.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> A
similar resolution was adopted by the Confederation of 1439.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
These decisions, however, were never fully carried out in
practice. In the second half of the fifteenth century, influenced
by the economic changes that were taking place and
encouraged by such radical humanistic ideas as those of John
Ostrorog, embodied in his <span lang="la">“Monumentum pro reipublicae
ordinatione congestum,”</span> the Polish nobility moved still more
resolutely toward the abolition of the tithes.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>In the sixteenth century this conflict became even more
determined. If the nobility objected to the tithes in the preceding
century, it did so now all the more. The wealth of
the church had increased as a result of the economic changes
in progress, the incomes of the clergy were princely, the needs
of the country greater and more exacting; and yet the clergy
shirked all public burdens and responsibilities. Naturally,
therefore, the nobility began to withhold the payments of
tithes. The situation was so serious that the clergy became
very much concerned. At several of the provincial synods,
notably those of 1544 and 1551, they gave a good deal of
time to discussions of ways and means by which to force the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
nobility to pay tithes.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> But the situation seemed to be beyond
repair. Incensed at the immunities, pretensions, and exactions
of the clergy, the nobility was turning away in great
numbers from the established church to the Reformation after
1550, and thereby was cutting down ecclesiastical revenues.</p>

<p>This touched the clergy in the most tender spot, and
aroused them to action. To save its revenues, the church
began to resort to the use of its ecclesiastical jurisdiction;
it summoned the rebellious nobles before its episcopal courts,
and if they did not relent and penitently submit, they were
placed under the ban of the church. This procedure put the
nobility, their persons, their honor, their property, and their
very lives at the mercy of the clergy. Their very existence,
individual and collective, was in jeopardy as long as they
were subject to the jurisdiction of episcopal courts. That
such a situation could not last long soon became perfectly
evident. The indignation of the nobility rose to a high pitch.
The relation between the two estates became more tense and
hostile than ever, and inevitably precipitated a bitter struggle
over the fundamental question of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the clergy now became an intolerable
burden to the Polish nobility. Its scope had gradually expanded
until, in the fifteenth century, in spite of protests
and attempts to fix limits, it came to cover not only questions
of religion, but also all sorts of civil matters. In fact, it so
happened that there was scarcely a question that the ecclesiastical
courts regarded as foreign to their jurisdiction. Their
authority, moreover, was greatly strengthened when the government,
by the Edict of Wieluń (1424) and by a statute of
1458 confirming it, committed the execution of their verdicts
to the starostas, thus lending the clergy the executive arm of
civil authority.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The administration of justice by ecclesiastical courts in
Poland in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was very
harsh, arbitrary, and light-minded. The most severe penalty,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
namely, that of excommunication, which carried the confiscation
of property, deprivation of honor, exile and death, was
frequently inflicted upon offenders for most trivial offenses.
A noble was in danger of excommunication for getting into a
fight and beating a precentor, an organist, or a grave-digger,
not to speak of more serious offenses, such as seizing or withholding
the tithes.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Sometimes a landlord was excommunicated
for offenses committed by his peasants on the ground
that he should have used his authority to bring the peasants
to terms and into submission to the church. So terrible in
its consequences was the church’s excommunication in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that everyone dreaded it.</p>

<p>Naturally, then, attempts were made very early to define
and limit the scope and authority of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
At the Convocation of 1420, in answer to the synodical
statutes of Nicholas Tromba, archbishop of Gniezno, the
nobility forbade its members to appeal to ecclesiastical
courts.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> According to a document of 1433, issued to Bishop
Bodzanta of Cracow, laymen were not to be cited before ecclesiastical
courts.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> In 1447 the nobility sought to confine
episcopal jurisdiction to matters strictly ecclesiastical, such
as questions of faith, heresy, marriage, and religious indifference
in cases of those that had not confessed once a year at
least.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Disputes over tithes, seized or withheld, according
to this foregoing agreement between the nobility and the
clergy, were to be settled in episcopal courts, but they were
to be adjudicated according to law. If the accused failed to
answer the first summons, a second one was to be issued to
him at his expense; and he could not be excommunicated
until he was duly tried.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> In matters belonging to civil
courts the clergy were forbidden by the Statute of 1496 to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
summon persons before their courts.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> By the Constitution
of 1505 civil matters were withdrawn from episcopal courts
altogether, and henceforth ecclesiastical judges were forbidden
to adjudicate them.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Furthermore, to avoid complications in
the administration of justice and to minimize difficulties in
the execution of verdicts, the Diet of 1532 called upon the
clergy in synod assembled to determine what cases they regarded
as belonging to their jurisdiction, and instructed the
commission appointed to revise existing laws to define the
exact scope of the jurisdiction of the spiritual and secular
courts.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Unfortunately, the commission allowed the episcopal
courts too wide a scope, and consequently its report was
rejected. The Statute of 1543 again undertook to define the
jurisdiction of the two classes of courts, but it was in force
for one year only.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> And once more, a statute of 1550, confirming
existing laws, provided that no person should be
summoned before any court unless his case fell within the
jurisdiction of that court,<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and a clergyman was forbidden
to hold the office of clerk in a secular provincial court.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>By 1550 the question of ecclesiastical jurisdiction became
one of the burning questions of the day. It was precipitated
by Orzechowski’s defiance of ecclesiastical authority. Stanislaus
Orzechowski was a nobleman priest in the diocese of
Przemyśl. He publicly announced that he would enter the
state of matrimony. Bishop Dziaduski of Przemyśl in turn
announced publicly that if Orzechowski should carry out his
intention he would excommunicate him at once, depriving
him of honor, confiscating his hereditary property, and exiling
him from the country. The bishop’s threat was a sweeping
violation of the most fundamental rights of the nobility
by the clergy. It endangered the nobility as a class. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Polish nobles were not slow to see that Orzechowski’s case
was not merely a question of church discipline, and that if
the Bishop of Przemyśl was allowed to carry out his threat,
their property and their lives would not be safe. They took
up Orzechowski’s case as their own, and rose to his defense.
They viewed the episcopal threat as an attack upon them and
their liberties, and therefore resolved to stand by Orzechowski.
The matter came before the Diet of 1550. Orzechowski found
supporters in some of the most influential magnates of Poland,
like James Górka, Martin Zborowski, Raphael Leszczyński,
Nicholas Radziwill, and Nicholas Oleśnicki, all of them adherents
and champions of the Reformation. Through the
intervention of John Tarnowski, grand hetman of Poland,
and Peter Kmita, starosta of Przemyśl, a compromise was
effected, the terms of which were that Orzechowski was to
apply to the Pope for sanction of his intention and was not
to be married until he received the Pope’s permission.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>The compromise was absurd. It did not settle anything;
it only delayed the settlement of the question raised. Górka
and Zborowski, therefore, spurred on Orzechowski to break
the compromise agreement and to carry out his plan in defiance
of episcopal authority.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The magnate Nicholas
Oleśnicki of Pińczów decided to make a test case of the whole
issue. On the advice of the Italian reformer Franciscus
Stankar, he broke openly with Roman Catholicism, accepting
the Reformed faith and taking away from the monks at
Pińczów their church and monastery. Immediately the
Polish bishops brought charges against him. He was tried,
not according to the canon law of the church, but according
to the law of the country, before the king and the senate.
He was acquitted on condition that he dismiss Stankar and
restore the seized monastery to the monks, neither of which
orders Oleśnicki actually carried out.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Thus spurred on by his friends, Orzechowski took courage,
renounced his clerical vows, and entered the state of matrimony.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Bishop Dziaduski, struck with consternation, did not
at first know what to do, but in the end resolved to carry out
his threat, On April 8, 1551, he issued his verdict against
Orzechowski, annulling his marriage and excommunicating
him. On presentation of the case by the primate to the
king, Sigismund Augustus confirmed the episcopal verdict
in accordance with his pledge given the Polish bishops in
December, 1550,<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and instructed Peter Kmita, starosta of
Przemyśl, to execute it. At the same time the king issued an
order to all the starostas to execute the verdicts of episcopal
courts in all cases of condemned and excommunicated heretics.
Excommunicated by the church, Orzechowski was deprived
of honor and property, exiled from the country, and
in danger of being put to death, if caught.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>The news of Orzechowski’s excommunication by Bishop
Dziaduski and of the royal confirmation of the episcopal verdict
without a trial came like a lightning stroke from the
clear sky. Orzechowski’s case was the first instance in the
history of the Polish Commonwealth of a noble deprived of
honor and of his hereditary possessions and condemned to
exile and death as a result of episcopal excommunication,
without due trial, according to law, guaranteed the Polish
nobility by the Charter of Jedlnia (1483). Immediately the
nobles, not only of Orzechowski’s province, but of the whole
of Poland, rose as one man against this high-handed attack
on their liberties both by the clergy and by the king. Orzechowski’s
neighbors were ready to defend him in case the
starosta tried to execute the verdict; but Peter Kmita neither
dared, nor wanted to execute it. He preferred to wait and
see what the Diet of 1552 was going to do about the whole
matter.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>The local diets of 1551, at which the szlachta elected the
deputies to the General Diet of 1552, fairly seethed with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
indignation of the Polish nobility. The clergy, on the other
hand, greatly elated over their apparent victory and pleased
with the king’s stand regarding the Orzechowski affair, called
a synod at Piotrków, at which they decided to bind the king
still closer to their cause by offering him the estates of all
condemned heretics; and to frighten the nobility into submission
they excommunicated at this synod Stadnicki and
Lasocki, two very influential and popular heretics in their respective
palatinates. The excommunicated magnates went
from one local diet to another, informed the szlachta of the
ecclesiastical verdicts, reported the resolutions of the synod,
and read the king’s pledge given the bishops secretly in 1550
in exchange for their consent to Queen Barbara’s coronation,
and which had been secured and made public by Nicholas
Lutomirski, castellan of Zawichow. They called upon the
szlachta to defend their lives and property.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>The indignation and anger of the nobility of Little Poland
rose so high that it almost reached the point of massacring
the clergy and of bringing in Protestant ministers from
abroad to take their places. As deputies to the Diet of 1552
they chose the most decided opponents of the clergy, and
instructed them to take up no measures until the king defined
episcopal authority and invalidated the above mentioned
verdicts of episcopal courts.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>The Diet of 1552 convened at Piotrków. The secular
nobility, both the senators and the deputies, were in a most
hostile frame of mind toward the clergy. Even as faithful a
Catholic as Hetman Jan Tarnowski refused to shake hands
with Bishop Dziaduski of Przemyśl, turning away from him,
when the latter came to the hetman’s house to greet him.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
Raphael Leszczyński, president of the Chamber of Deputies,
stood with his head covered during the celebration of the
opening mass. When the diet had been duly opened, the
Chamber, under the leadership of Leszczyński, unequivocally
demanded the abolition of episcopal jurisdiction, stating that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
no other measure would be considered until that demand was
complied with. The secular portion of the Senate, under the
leadership of Jan Tarnowski, did not go quite so far, but it
seconded the Chamber’s demand to this extent, that it, too,
called for bringing ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the
limits of law.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The Polish nobility stood firm by their
demand for the abolition of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The
bishops, on the other hand, were equally determined not to
surrender it. The decision rested finally with the king.
After a bitter struggle of two months, due partly to the royal
vacillation, the king at last handed a decision that in all
cases of heresy the bishops have jurisdiction. The verdict
created no small consternation among the secular senators
as well as among the deputies. But, though apparently fully
victorious, the bishops, sensing the feeling against them and
taking counsel of wisdom in time, consented to suspension of
their jurisdiction for one year until at the next diet or at a
national synod the country’s laws and the church’s canons
could be harmonized, provided the nobles agreed to continue
the payment of tithes.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>This concession on the part of the Polish episcopate, did
not, however, conciliate the Polish nobility. The nobles felt
that their rights and liberties had been outraged and were
in danger of being completely violated. The turn of events
in 1552 made them only all the more determined to fight.
In great numbers they came out now for the Reformation.
Inside of one year nearly all the Polish nobility, according
to Dr. Kubala, left the Roman Catholic Church and embraced
the faith of the Reformation. The speed with which the
Polish nobles tried to change their form of worship had no
parallel. They invited reformers from abroad; they converted
their manor houses into places of worship; they built
hospitals, schools, and homes of refuge for persecuted dissidents;
and the new doctrines were preached through the
whole length and breadth of the country.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Great Poland,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
where the influence of Hussitism still survived, accepted,
under the leadership of James Ostrorog, the tenets of faith
and form of worship of the Bohemian Brethren. By 1557
there were thirty Bohemian Brethren churches in Great
Poland, and all the leading aristocratic families, the Ostrorogs,
the Leszczyńskis, the Tomickis, the Krotowskis, and the
Opalińskis, turned Protestant.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Little Poland, under the
leadership of the Zborowskis, Nicholas Oleśnicki, and Stanislaus
Stadnicki, became Calvinistic. In “terra Sandeceniensis,”
the home province of Orzechowski, all the nobility
became Protestant by 1554; and by 1560, according to a letter
of Bishop Przyrębski to Bishop Kamerini, one hundred and
sixty churches in Little Poland broke away from the jurisdiction
of the Church of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> In Lithuania, under the leadership
of Nicholas Radziwill, the foremost aristocratic families
accepted Calvinism. They were the Radziwills, the Kiszkas,
the Chlebowiczes, the Sapiehas, the Słuźkis, the Zawiszes, the
Wiśniowieckis, the Wojnas, the Paces, the Abramowiczes, the
Wołowiczes, the Ogińskis, the Zienowiczes, the Pruńskis, the
Naruszewiczes, the Talwoczes, the Drohostajskis, the Puzynas,
the Szemiotas, the Gruźewskis, the Góreckis, and others. By
1559 the Catholics in Lithuania constituted only one-thousandth
part of the population.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> So strong was the
sentiment now against the Church of Rome that men well
known for their antagonism to Rome, like James Uchański
and Andrew Frycz Modrzewski, were selected and sent as
Poland’s delegates to the Council of Trent.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> In 1535 at
the Diet at Piotrków the calling of a National Synod to
adjust the existing differences and difficulties was agreed
upon, and a delegation was dispatched to Rome by the king
with a request for the Pope’s sanction of that plan as well
as of a number of practical reforms. Needless to say, the
desired papal sanction was not granted. On the contrary,
the Pope immediately sent a legate to Poland in the person
of Alois Lippomano, bishop of Verona, to stave off any such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
possibilities. In his first interview with the king Lippomano
advised the Polish monarch, for the sake of an example and
a warning, to execute twenty leading dissidents. Owing to
his harshness and lack of tact, this papal nuncio became so
unpopular in Poland, that when in 1556 he entered the Diet
Chamber, the deputies shouted: <span lang="la">“Salve, progenies viperarum!”</span><a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
At the Diet of 1557 security and freedom were
guaranteed all foreign Reformed ministers.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>As to episcopal jurisdiction, this became a lost cause after
1552. The bishops, having once agreed to its suspension,
though only temporary, were unable to recover it again, in
spite of desperate attempts.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> By a statute of the Diet of
1562-1563, all excommunicated persons were admitted to provincial
and fortress courts (<span lang="pl">do sądow ziemskich i grodzkich</span>)
with their grievances and complaints, and the starostas were
instructed to respect the constitutionally guaranteed privileges
of the szlachta.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The result was that no one wanted
now either to appeal to or to appear in any episcopal court.
This took the teeth out of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Moreover,
by the Constitution of 1565 the clergy were forbidden
to summon before their courts starostas who in compliance
with the statutory law of 1562-1563 refused to execute the
verdicts of episcopal courts.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Deprived of the executive
arm of civil authority, ecclesiastical courts became powerless
and their verdicts of no effect. This was a great victory for
the Polish nobility. At last their lives and their property
were safe from further attacks of the clergy through arbitrary
exercise of their ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</p>

<p>All the grievances of the Polish nobility in the sixteenth
century were summed up and the remedies for these grievances
were contained in the demand for “the execution of
laws.” It was a demand of the Polish nobility for a return
to the fundamental constitutional laws of the land, for conformity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
in private and public life to these laws, and for
elimination of abuses. Many of the social and political ills
and problems of the times were due either to disregard or to
open violation of existing constitutional and statutory laws.
For instance, after 1454 and particularly so after 1504, it
became illegal for the king either to pledge or to grant any
part of his royal lands to any private individual or to any
institution without the sanction of the diet.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The extravagant
liberality of the Polish rulers had made it necessary to
make these restrictions; they were intended to safeguard the
royal domain from undue diminution, the royal treasury from
embarassing impoverishment, and the country from inadequate
defense. Also, it became illegal after 1454, and especially
after 1505, for the king to make any new laws or to
issue edicts having the force of new laws without the common
consent of the two chambers of the diet.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> It was illegal,
also, for the clergy to enlarge their landed estates either by
purchase or by gift, while they evaded the responsibility of
participation in the country’s defense.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Likewise, it was
illegal for the king to confer upon them special privileges,
exempting them from various public burdens.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Moreover,
it was a flagrant violation of the constitutionally guaranteed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
rights of the szlachta for the clergy to sit as their judges in
matters of life, liberty, and property.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Yet all these violations
and abuses had become so common that they almost had
the force of perfectly lawful acts and practices. For a time
they were tolerated. But when they began seriously to interfere
with the liberties and economic interests of the Polish
nobility, the nobles rose against them resolutely, and with
determination demanded a general reformation of conditions.</p>

<p>Their demand for “the execution of laws” was directed
particularly against the special privileges and immunities,
real or pretended, of the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Beginning with the Diet
of 1511,<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> both the secular and the regular clergy were repeatedly
called upon by the diets of the sixteenth century to
justify their specially privileged status and their evasion of
public responsibilities and burdens by presenting their charters
for examination, until at last they were forced to comply
with this demand in part at least.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The continued insistence
on the part of the nobility on the clergy’s participation
in public burdens resulted finally in the imposition by the
Diet of 1563 of a regular tax on episcopal property and
tithes.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> In the struggle regarding ecclesiastical jurisdiction
the nobility appealed to its privileges of 1422, 1433, 1454,
and the Constitution of 1505, demanding the annulment of
all royal edicts against heresy as unconstitutional, together
with ecclesiastical jurisdiction in matters involving the
nobility’s constitutional rights to life and property. As a
result of this appeal and demand the king issued instructions
to the starostas in 1563 to respect the constitutional rights
of the nobility. By this act the royal edicts against heresy
and episcopal jurisdiction, whether in cases of heresy or of
refusal to pay tithes, became invalidated and rendered of
no effect.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>Thus, we see that the conflict between the Polish nobility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and the ecclesiastical authorities in the sixteenth century, resulting
in the former’s extensive revolt from the established
church, was due mainly to the wealth of the Polish clergy,
their immunities from public burdens, and their abuse of
episcopal jurisdiction; for these not only increased the burdens
of the Polish nobility, but also seriously menaced its
social and economic status. Whatever particular form this
conflict assumed, its underlying motives were essentially
economic and social rather than religious or even purely
political.</p>

<p>1. Edict of Wieluń of 1424.—<span lang="la">Contra Haereticos et Fautores
Eorum Vladislaus Jagiello in Vieluń Constituit. Significamus
tenore praesentium quibus expedit; universis praesentibus
et futuris harum notitiam habituris, quod cum sub
dissimulatione praeterire non debemus imo arcemur Divinae
legis perpetuis institutis, pestiferos haereticorum errores, quos
in Dei contemptum et in Christianae fidei detrimentum et
enervationem politiaeque jacturam, iniqua perversorum corda
conflaverunt, etiamsi quaecunque oporteret nos subire pericula,
a finibus nostris propulsare, et in gladio dejicere, ut qui censura
ecclesiae non terrentur, humana severitate mulctentur,
maturo consilio Praelatorum, Principum et Baronum nostrorum
habito et consensu, et etiam de certa ipsorum et
nostra scientia praesentibus decernimus, et pro firmo constanti
atque irrefragabili edicto teneri praecipimus. Ut quicunque
in Regno Nostro Poloniae et Terris Nobis subjectis
haereticus, aut haeresi infectus vel suspectus de eadem, fautor
eorum vel director repertus fuerit, … velut Regiae Majestatis
offensor capiatur, et juxta exigentiam excessus sui puniatur,
et quicunque venerint de Bohemia et intrant Regnum
nostrum, ordinariorum suorum examini aut magistrorum haereticae
pravitatis ad hoc a Sede Apostolica deputatorum vel
deputandorum subdentur comprehensi. Si quis autem incolarum
Regni nostri cujuscunque status, dignitatis, gradus
aut conditionis fuerit, hinc ad Festum Ascensionis Domini
proximum redire de Bohemia neglexerit, noluerit, vel contempserit,
pro convicto haeretico censeatur et poenis subjaceat,
quae haereticis infligi consveverunt, nec amplius ad
Regnum nostrum revertatur moraturus. Et nihilominus
omnia bona ipsorum mobilia et immobilia in quibuscunque
rebus consistentia publicentur thesauro nostro confiscanda,
prolesque eorum tam masculina, quam feminea omni careat
successione perpetuo et honore, nec unquam ad aliquas assumatur
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
dignitates vel honores, sed cum patribus et progenitoribus
suis semper maneat infamis; nec de caetero gaudeat
aliquo privilegio nobilitatis vel decore. Inhibemus etiam sub
eisdem poenis, omnibus mercatoribus et alijs hominibus cujuscunque
conditionis fuerint, ut amodo et in posterum

<p class="p2 hanging">STUDIES IN THE HISTORY OF MEDIAEVAL SCIENCE,
by Charles Homer Haskins</p>

<p class="unindent">Based upon years of research in European manuscript collections, this
work discusses the science of the Arabs and its transmission to western
Europe; the Greek phase of the mediaeval scientific renaissance; the
Sicilian court of Frederick <abbr title="Two">II</abbr> on its scientific side as the meeting point
of these Arabic and Greek currents; and, in a final section, the introduction
of the abacus into the English exchequer, Syrian astronomy
and western falconry, and a list of text-books in use at the close of the
twelfth century. $6.00.</p>

<p class="unindent">Professor Lord has recently had the opportunity of using and transcribing
in full the seven volumes of documents in the archives of the
German Foreign Office which contain the German official record of the
diplomatic crisis leading up to the outbreak of the War of 1870. Save
for rare exceptions, these documents have never hitherto been printed
but they are now published <i lang="la">in extenso</i>. As an introduction Professor
Lord has retraced the history of the crisis in the light of the mass of
new sources. $3.50.</p>


<p class="p2 hanging">HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES POST OFFICE TO
THE YEAR 1829, by Wesley E. Rich</p>

<p class="unindent">Scarcely an activity of the Federal government so intimately affects
the life of the ordinary citizen as the service of the Post Office Department,
the early history of which is here recounted with a fullness that
ensures an instructive and entertaining book. The quaint regulations
the author cites from time to time, the numerous quotations he brings
forth from old manuscript letters and reports, even his discussions of
financial operations and of politics, are full of the homely detail that
makes the past vividly alive again. $2.00.</p>

<p class="p2">The Institute for Government Research is an association of citizens for
co-operating with public officials in the scientific study of government with
a view to promoting efficiency and economy in its operations and advancing
the science of administration. It aims to bring into existence such information
and materials as will aid in the formation of public opinion and will
assist officials particularly those of the National Government, in their
efforts to put the public administration upon a more efficient basis.</p>

<p>To this end it seeks, by the thoroughgoing study and examination of the
best administrative practices, public and private, American and foreign, to
formulate those principles which lie at the basis of all sound administration,
and to determine their proper adaptation to the specific needs of our
public administration.</p>

<p class="p2">The present Japanese Government is today the best example of
a monarchy in which extensive constitutional powers are vested
in the Crown. A critical examination of this Government, from
the juristic and political points of view is, therefore, of especial
interest both to students of public law and to those who desire
an understanding of the public policies and political methods of
Japan. Such an examination has been made by Dr. Nakano in
the present volume, for, so wide are the ordinance powers of the
Emperor, a study of them in all their phases necessitates a general
consideration of the more important features of the entire
Japanese constitutional system. Dr. Nakano’s conclusions are
stated without reservation or undue regard for such opinions
current in his country as he believes erroneous. As a result, the
reader is given an insight into Japanese constitutional and
political thought which cannot readily be elsewhere obtained.</p>
